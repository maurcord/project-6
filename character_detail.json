  "deck": "The man who ruled over Nazi Germany during World War II. He wished to wipe leftists, Jews and other \"inferiors\" from the planet and rule over the world propagating an Aryan race agenda, an ideal that he oddly did not fall into himself.",
  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Adolf Hitler was born in 1889 to a middle-class <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55915\" href=\"/austria/4020-55915/\">Austrian</a> family. Though he initially excelled in school and was outgoing, the death of his younger brother in 1900 severely affected the young Hitler, making him morose and combative. He was close to his mother, Klara Polzl, but had a difficult relationship with his father, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62798\" href=\"/alois-hitler/4005-62798/\">Alois Hitler</a>, who beat Adolf regularly. He attended a Catholic school and, when he was old enough, was sent by his father to a technical school. Hitler, who harboured a dream of becoming an artist, intentionally failed his first year there in the hopes of causing his father to relent. When he did not, Hitler became even more sullen. When his father died in 1903, Hitler became more disruptive at the school and was asked to leave. He enrolled in the Realschule in 1904, but was asked to leave following his first year due again to disruptive behaviour. Around this time, Hitler became interested in German Nationalism.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>He never returned to formal schooling. By 1905 he was living on little money in Vienna. In 1907 he applied to and was rejected by the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts who deemed him to be an unfit painter and encouraged him to pursue architecture. However, he lacked academic qualifications to enter architectural school. His mother passed away in 1907, and Hitler gave his orphan's pension money to his sister, Paula. In 1908 he was again rejected by the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, and began to run out of money. In 1909 he lived in a homeless shelter, before obtaining residence in a house for poor working men in 1910. While there he continued to sell paintings that he had copied from postcards. In 1913 he moved to Munich after receiving the last of his father's estate.</p><p>By this time he claimed he had become an anti-Semite, influenced by the heavy racial prejudice in Vienna, contemporary ideologist Lanz von Liebenfels, and the writings of various thinkers such as Martin Luther and Karl Lueger. Though he claimed to be firmly anti-Semitic, in the earlier years of his life he interacted with Jews with no problem. Nonetheless, he claimed to view Jews as enemies to the Aryans, and quickly combined his anti-Semitism with anti-Marxism, two ideologies that would feature heavily in his later regime.</p><p>Though he had initially avoided military service in Austria, Hitler willingly enlisted in the Bavarian army when <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\" href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\">Germany</a> entered World War I. He fought in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\" href=\"/france/4020-55778/\">France</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55916\" href=\"/belgium/4020-55916/\">Belgium</a> and was present for a number of important battles throughout the war. He received a number of awards, the Iron Cross Second Class in 1914, Iron Cross First Class in 1918 and finally the Wound Badge in 1917, which he received following an injury in the Battle of the Somme. In 1918 he was again injured, this time blinded by a mustard gas attack. When Germany surrendered in 1918 Hitler was shocked and angered, believing in the stab-in-the-back legend, that the soldiers in the field had been sold out by the Marxists in the high command in Germany. He would later use the actions of the \"November Criminals\" to bolster his ascent to power.</p><p>In 1919 he became a spy for the Reichswehr and was sent to infiltrate the German Worker's Party. Instead, he was impressed by the anti-Semitic, nationalistic ideals of the party and, upon invitation from the leader who had been impressed by Hitler's skill for oratory, became a member in September 1919. At the same time he became involved with the Thule Society, an occultist group which would later influence some of his racial ideology. In 1921 he was growing in oratory ability but was dislike by other members of the party, who felt he was too overbearing. He threatened to leave the party, now called the National Socialist German Worker's Party (NSDAP), which would effectively destroy it, unless he was made chairman. Eventually the leadership relented.</p><p>In 1923, due to all of the support he was accumulating, he attempted to overthrow the government of Bavaria, with the final goal being control of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55686\" href=\"/berlin/4020-55686/\">Berlin</a>, in an action that was later called the Beer Hall Putsch. His attempted coup failed, however, and Hitler was charged with high treason and, in 1924, was sentenced to five years in jail. During his time in prison he wrote his autobiography/ manifesto, <i>Mein Kampf</i>. He was pardoned and released from jail in December of 1924. While he was imprisoned, the NSDAP was made illegal. By 1925 he had managed to talk the Prime Minister of Bavaria to lift the ban, but he himself was banned from speaking publicly due to his inflammatory speech. He appointed George Strasser to replace him as voice of the party, but Strasser emphasized the socialist elements of the party too heavily and Hitler removed him from this position, instead placing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31685\" href=\"/joseph-goebbels/4005-31685/\">Joseph Goebbels</a> in charge.</p><p>In his rise to power he played on the injustice that the German people felt had been perpetrated against them by the Treaty of Versailles, which had demanded exorbitant reparations. This was soon coupled with the stresses felt by the German people when the Great Depression hit Germany in 1930. In 1932 he intended to run for president against then-president Paul von Hindenburg, but he was not technically a German citizen and so was unable. In February a minister in Brunswick, a Nazi, gave Hitler a position that conferred upon Hitler citizenship, allowing him to run. He lost the election to Hindenburg, but gained a fairly large percentage of the vote; about 35% of Germans voted for him. All was not lost in Hitler's ambition for power, as he was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933.</p><p>As chancellor he was able to prevent his opponents from gaining a majority, which forced Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag. Elections were scheduled for March, but a fire at the Reichstag in February provided the perfect way for Hitler to seize power. He blamed the fire on a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56975\" href=\"/communists/4060-56975/\">communist</a> plot and used it to suspend basic rights in Germany. In the lead up to the elections he used violence and anti-communist hysteria to whip up support for his party. When the elections came around he had achieved a better percentage, 43.9%, but was still unable to create a majority government. This was quickly remedied with the introduction of the Enabling Act, which allowed legislative powers for the cabinet as well as contraventions of the constitution. It passed with a two-thirds majority in late March. What followed was a swift suppression and elimination of other parties that finally ended in July when the Nazi party was declared the one legal party in Germany. He purged the Sturmabteilung (SA) in the Night of the Long Knives, as well as removing opponents in the party like George Strasser. He forced Hindenburg out of power, and, when the president died in August of 1934 he dissolved the post of president and styled himself Fuhrer und Reichskanzler, as well as becoming commander of the armed forces. There was now no legal recourse to remove Hitler's power and no checks or balances on his actions.</p><p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4060-49867\" href=\"/third-reich/4060-49867/\">Third Reich</a> now established, Hitler set about modeling Germany into his version of utopia. He succeeded in substantially reducing the amount of unemployment in Germany by revitalizing industry in the country and commissioning the creation of railways, dams and other social works projects. Culturally, he focused on traditional German values and encouraged women to remain in the home and bear children, even going so far as to create a medal, the Cross of Honor of the German Mother, that was awarded to any woman who bore four or more children. He was heavily focused on rearmament, which he began almost as soon as he seized power. he focused heavily on the ideals of <i>lebensraum</i> (\"living space\"), which involved the invasion and absorption of traditional German lands as well as the execution or subordination of the non-Germanic peoples who lived in these regions, and <i>Anschluss</i> (\"link-up\"), the annexation of Austria. He hoped to forge an alliance with <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\" href=\"/england/4020-55794/\">Britain</a> but ultimately failed. Instead he was able to create alliances with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9672\" href=\"/benito-mussolini/4005-9672/\">Benito Mussolini's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55920\" href=\"/italy/4020-55920/\">Italy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32592\" href=\"/hirohito/4005-32592/\">Emperor Hirohito's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\" href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\">Japan</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-28624\" href=\"/josef-stalin/4005-28624/\">Joseph Stalin's</a> Soviet Union, the last of which he would later betray, to his loss.</p><p>Perhaps Hitler is best known, and most reviled, for the Holocaust, the systematic oppression, persecution and, eventually, mass execution of various \"undesirables\". These actions were first taken against disabled children, but quickly expanded to Jews, Communists, homosexuals, Roma, <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55922\" href=\"/poland/4020-55922/\">Poles</a>, political opponents, resistance members, trade unionists, the physically and mentally handicapped, psychiatric patients, Soviet POWs, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Adventists. The total deaths he presided over are between 11 and 14 million. The peak of these activities took place between 1939 and 1945, and occurred mainly in concentration and extermination camps that were scattered throughout Germany and conquered lands. The Holocaust was supported by Hitler's belief of the principles of eugenics, a pseudo-science that was based around the idea of racial purity. By about 1941 he had determined the \"Final Solution\" along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8056\" href=\"/heinrich-himmler/4005-8056/\">Heinrich Himmler</a>; they decided the best way to remove the \"undesirables\" was by mass gassing. Though he was never personally involved in the death camps, he did have an important role in their creation and implementation.</p><p>In 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, causing Britain and France to declare war on Germany. Though they had some early successes on the Western Front, Hitler began to seize more and more control of the German army, much to its detriment. In 1941 he broke the non-aggression pact he had established with Soviet <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55706\" href=\"/russia/4020-55706/\">Russia</a>, opening up war on the Eastern Front while still fighting on the Western Front. This stretched the German army incredibly thin, and they suffered their most devastating defeat at Stalingrad in 1943, when they were overwhelmed by the Russian army. Hitler became less and less capable of stable leadership at a time when the German war effort was floundering. His health began deteriorating as well, along with Germany's economy. It has been suggested that he may have suffered from Parkinson's or, less likely, syphilitic infection. Neither has been conclusively proven. In 1943, one of Hitler's major allies, Mussolini, was deposed, and in 1944 the Allied invasion of D-Day meant that many in Germany knew that German defeat was an inevitability.</p><p>In July of 1944 an attempt was made on Hitler's life in what would come to be known as the 20 July Plot. Orchestrated by a high-ranking member of the army, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15874\" href=\"/stauffenberg/4005-15874/\">Claus von Stauffenberg</a>, the attempt almost took Hitler's life and resulted in a series of vicious reprisals on his part that brought about almost 5,000 deaths. This removed much of the resistance in Germany but did not alter the fact that defeat was inexorably bearing down on Germany.</p><p>As 1944 progressed the Soviet Army had succeeded in driving back the Germans while the Western Allies had begun to invade Germany itself. By this point Hitler was well aware that he had lost but was not willing to give up without a fight. Even as he contemplated negotiating peace with Britain and America he allowed the Holocaust to continue unabated. Hitler hoped to undertake a scorched earth policy, but the man he entrusted with the plan refused to undertake his orders. The Soviets entered Berlin in April of 1945. Hitler refused to leave the city, taking shelter in the Fuhrerbunker along with several important members of the Nazi high command, including Goebbels and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-32717\" href=\"/martin-bormann/4005-32717/\">Martin Bormann</a>. On April 30th, 1945 he committed suicide by shooting himself while taking a potassium cyanide capsule. He and his new wife <a data-ref-id=\"4005-20943\" href=\"/eva-braun/4005-20943/\">Eva Braun</a>, who he had married the day previous and who had also committed suicide, were placed in a bomb crater, doused in gasoline and set on fire.</p><h2>In Comics</h2><p>Hitler was the original arch-foe, as every hero in the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\" href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\">Golden Age</a> did their part to kill the Fuhrer. In the DC Universe, Hitler protected Nazi Germany from being invaded by super powered beings like Superman, Dr Fate, Wonder Woman and the Spectre through his acquisition of two powerful artifacts, the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-47001\" href=\"/spear-of-destiny/4055-47001/\">Spear of Destiny</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55784\" href=\"/holy-grail/4055-55784/\">Holy Grail</a> to create a barrier around axis territory to prevent super powered heroes such as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\" href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\">Justice Society Of America</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41753\" href=\"/all-star-squadron/4060-41753/\">All-Star Squadron</a> from invading Germany.</p><p>In the Marvel Universe, the original Hitler was confronted in his bunker by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12605\" href=\"/jim-hammond/4005-12605/\">Jim Hammond</a>, the original Human Torch and his sidekick, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11835\" href=\"/toro/4005-11835/\">Toro</a> after his wife, Eva Braun committed suicide. The duo set Hitler ablaze as he prepares to set off a bomb. As Hitler dies, he commands one of his loyal followers to tell the world Hitler had committed suicide. In reality, Hitler was cloned and later appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"4000-6826\" href=\"/fantastic-four-the-hate-monger/4000-6826/\">Fantastic Four #21</a> to face the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\" href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> as the first <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12064\" href=\"/hate-monger/4005-12064/\">Hate Monger</a>.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p>In the <i>Justice League</i> episode \"A Savage Time\", the villain <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5722\" href=\"/vandal-savage/4005-5722/\">Vandal Savage</a> replaced Hitler (though he's not mentioned by name) as leader of the Axis Powers.

When he first arrives he shows confidence to Goku saying that he knows that he will win this battle. While Future Trunks and Vegeta fought against 14 and 15 alone. Goku after transforming into a Super Saiyan was able to get fight in his favor, some time later Piccolo arrives to aid Goku. Vegeta and Trunks defeat 14 and 15, by transforming into Super Saiyans.

Another of his personality traits is his closeness to nature, especially little animals, which he kindly lets climb on his shoulders.</p><p>He proved pivotal in defending <a href=\"/android-17/4005-40804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40804\"> 17</a> and <a href=\"/android-18/4005-40728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40728\"> 18</a> against Cell, but was eventually severely injured by the latter.</p><p>He reappeared for the Cell Games, having been repaired by Bulma Briefs, but failed to eliminate Cell due to Bulma's decision to remove his emergency self-destruction device. He was destroyed by Cell, which enabled <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\"> Gohan</a> to feel enough anger to finally fight with all his potential against the creature.</p><h2>Power</h2><p>Android 16 is the one of the strongest androids in the Z series, second only to Cell. Daizenshuu 7's character bio lists him as the strongest mechanical android on the same page the Androids from the Super Android 13 film are mentioned, so 16 being stronger than Super 13 is a possibility.</p><p>16 is capable of flight, and can detach his lower arms to send a flying fist at his opponents, or blast them with his Hell Flash technique.</p>",

Together they all sought Goku to complete their mission. On their way, 17 tried to get <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> to reveal where Goku was, as since he was in bed with the heart virus, never appeared. 17 fought with Piccolo, who was confident now that he merged with <a href=\"/kami/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\">Kami</a> and become a Super <a href=\"/namekians/4060-55883/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55883\">Namekian</a>, before Cell appeared, and absorbed 17 so he could reach his Perfect Form. After absorbing 17, Cell gained a tremendous spike in power, and gained the strength to defeat <a href=\"/android-16/4005-45707/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45707\">16</a>.</p><p>After Cell's defeat, the <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragonballs</a> were used to resurrect all those that Cell had killed, including 17. He was later seen leading a normal life and donating his energy to help Goku defeat <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Majin Buu</a>.</p><h3>Alternate Reality</h3><p>In an alternate future, 17 and 18 easily killed all of the <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a>, leaving only <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> and Trunks. This version was far more evil and ruthless. Gohan was killed in battle and Trunks came back in time to warn those from the past of the androids awakening. Trunks helped in the past and returned to the future far more powerful, easily killing both androids.</p><h3>Dragon Ball GT</h3><p>In Dragon Ball GT Android 17 was used by Gero and Dr.Myuu to merge with another Android 17 designed by them in hell. The fusion resulted in the creation of a new villain Super Android 17, while Gero believed he was controlling the Android but Dr.Myuu was actually the one giving orders Gero was Killed by Super Android 17 who also killed Dr.Myuu later after being confronted by Android 18 about taking orders from others and not being able to make his own decisions. He was defeated by Goku and Android 18 working together, 18 distracted him while Goku used Dragon Fist attack on 17 to finish him.</p><h3>Dragon Ball Super</h3><p>17 works for a wildlife reserve and is battling with some poachers and is confronted by Goku who offers to help but with  17 replying not to kill the poachers. Eventually, the poachers are retreat. Goku, wanting to see how strong 17 is, offers to fight with 17 of which he accepts.</p><p> </p><p>Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan and clashes with 17 but is overwhelmed. Goku decides to transform into a Super Saiyan Blue. They fought an even match until 17 decided to stop the match due to the dolphins breaching. 17 and Goku later have a conversation with Goku asking 17 if he once to join the Universe 7 team at which 17 refuses but later joins after Goku helps 17 defeat an alien boss.</p><p> </p><p>In the Universe 7 saga, 17 along with his Universe 7 teammates battle the opposing teams with 17 battling the Pride Troopers and beating them.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>17 like his sister 18 was experimented upon by Dr. Gero and had cybernetic graphs implanted in his body to exceed any of the Z-Fighters at the time. Android 17 has strength, speed, enhanced durability, and is noted to be physically stronger than his sister. Also like his sister 17 has an internal energy source that never runs out giving him unlimited energy and stamina in a fight. At activation 17 had enough power to dominate over Vegeta, Future Trunks, Piccolo, and Tien Shinhan and then to match-up to Piccolo after he fused with Kami. While during the Cell Saga 17's power was quickly eclipsed by most of the Z-Fighters and Cell himself, 17 was still considered quite powerful. By the time of the Universe Survival arc 17 had been training in secret for 10 years and now can match up to a suppressed SS Blue Goku though 17 was holding back as well. This means 17 now has power in the same league as SS Bue Goku, SS Blue Vegeta, Golden Frieza, Goku Black, and Mystic Gohan.</p><p> </p><h3>Techniques:</h3><p> </p><p><strong>Android Barrier </strong>- 17 creates a blue powerful barrier made out off energy which he uses to protect himself from attacks. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Accel Dance</strong> - This is a technique where 17 and his sister, 18, attack an enemy with combos and finishes the attack with a barrage of yellow ki blasts to a downed opponent.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

They were free to move on their own, but still held the desire to kill Goku. They did release<a href=\"/android-16/4005-45707/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45707\"> Android 16</a> out of curiosity and them him join their quest. As the androids cane across the <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a>, 18 easily defeated the <a href=\"/super-saiyan/4015-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55690\">Super Saiyan</a> powered <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and his son <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Future Trunks</a>. Before she left, she gave <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Krillin</a> a small kiss on his cheek before they flew off to search for Goku and destroy everything in their way.</p><h3>Cell Saga</h3><p>Unbeknownst to the androids, a new threat appeared on Earth at that time, <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a>. Another creation of Dr. Gero, he was to be the most powerful warrior once his mutation would be complete. For that purpose, he needed to absorb Androids 17 and 18. After escaping a confrontation with <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>, he eventually caught up with the androids and quickly defeated 16 and Piccolo, who were trying to prevent the mutation, and absorbed 17. Cell then turned to 18 and tried to convince her to \"unite her strength with his to make Master Gero's dream come true\" using 17's voice. She however declined, as her brother would never have called Gero \"master\" after all the suffering he caused them. She then threatened Cell to use her emergency self-destroying bomb, only for Cell to remark that, while the bomb would be charging, he would have more than enough time to absorb her before the deflagration. Thanks to <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tien</a>'s intervention, Android 18 succeeded in escaping with a battle-worn 16, and went into hiding on one of the near-by islands.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the Capsule Corporation, <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma Briefs</a> succeeded in recreating the remote that would turn off Androids 17 and 18. As she was on her way to meet the androids, she met Krillin and gave him the device, adding that it would only work in a close range. While Cell was busy fighting Vegeta and Trunks, Krillin found the two androids hiding just below the fighters. But the kiss Android 18 gave him earlier had just stirred feelings in him, and he chose to destroy the remote instead of using it. Upon hearing the device break, 18 finally noticed Krillin and told him he was irresponsible for getting rid of the only thing that could have prevented effectively her absorption by Cell.</p><p>That is when Cell finally noticed them, and despite Krillin's, Trunks' and 16's efforts, 18 proved no match and was absorbed, allowing Cell to complete his mutation and obtain a \"perfect body\".</p><p>Later on, during the Cell Games, <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> hit Cell so hard that he spit out 18's unconscious body. Krillin took care of her and, after Cell's demise, brought her to Dende so that he could reanimate her. When she was told of what had happened since Cell absorbed her, Gohan innocently revealed Krillin's feelings towards 18. She was surprised and turned her back on him, flying off. But as she was leaving, the Z-Fighters, having previously gathered the seven Dragon Balls, called on the dragon to grant their wishes. She stayed to witness what was happening, and saw them ask the dragon to revive Trunks - who had died during the battle - and Cell's other victims, but could not do the same for Goku, who preferred to stay dead so he would not attract any more threats. Instead, Krillin asked the dragon to make 17 and 18 humans again. The dragon could not grant this wish as the androids were more powerful than he was, so Krillin asked for their emergency bombs to be removed. When confronted by his friends, he confessed that he just wanted to make 18 happy, and thought they would be a perfect match - no one knew that 17 and 18 were siblings. Android 18 then came out of hiding to reveal that 17 was her twin brother and certainly not her lover, and that she could never love Krillin anyway. However, before leaving, she did not say \"goodbye\", but \"see you soon\".</p><h3>Buu Arc</h3><p>Android 18 was next seen a few years later, when Gohan visited her and Krillin. The two had meanwhile got married and had a daughter named <a href=\"/marron/4005-61587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61587\">Marron</a>. Gohan was gathering the Z-Fighters for the 25th Martial Arts World Tournament. Upon learning about the substantial sums that were offered as prize money, she immediately accepted for both her husband and herself.</p><p>When the tournament was interrupted after two contestants working for <a href=\"/babidi/4005-51121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51121\">Babidi </a>attacked Gohan, 18 decided not to take part in the chase and stayed on for the money, along with four other contestants, among whom were <a href=\"/hercule/4005-46397/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46397\">Mr. Satan </a>(the defending champion who fraudulently claimed to have beaten Cell), and a mysterious fighter who was in fact <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks </a>and <a href=\"/goten/4005-40745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40745\">Goten </a>under a disguise. Satan suggested the tournament should go on as a \"Battle Royale\", with all five contestants fighting at the same time; whoever would be the last one standing would be crowned as the champion.</p><p>18 sensed that the mysterious fighter (Trunks/Goten) was potentially her strongest opponent, so she decided to go for him. Meanwhile, the kids also considered 18 as their most dangerous opponents, Trunks telling Goten that he had heard Krillin's wife was stronger than her husband. After pushing the two insignificant fighters out of the ring in on hit, Android 18 and Trunks/Goten started fighting, completely ignoring Satan. Eventually, 18 guessed who her opponent really was, and used one of Krillin's techniques to slice apart the boys' costume, revealing the fraud.</p><p>With only Satan left, 18 knew she was the strongest, but instead of beating him she resorted to blackmail : she told Satan he could keep his crown by arranging the outcome; she would pretend to lose to him if he paid her twice the victor's prize money. Satan accepted, and 18 lost on purpose.</p><p> </p><p>She is later turned into candy by Super Buu and eaten.</p><p> </p><p>She eventually got her cash after <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Buu</a>'s defeat, but not before reluctantly helping Satan getting rid of a biochemically reborn <a href=\"/broly/4005-46299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46299\">Broly</a> with the help of Krillin, and more importantly Trunks and Goten.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Android 18 is an android, and at her baselin power level, has the strength, speed, endurance and durability that surpasses a Super Sayian 1. She can effortlessly lift more than 300 tons, can move, fly and fight at super-sonic speeds, and can readily endure the best attacks of Super Saiyin Trunks and Super Saiyin Vegeta, at that time (Goku had already fallen sick). She easily took on Super Sayian Vegeta in both speed and strength, and was able to break Vegeta's arm with a single kick; an impressive feat of strength against a Super Sayian's durability. At another point, Android 18 fights against not just one but two Super Sayians at the same time. During the World Martial Arts Tournament (Adult Division.) Goten and Trunks disguised themselves as Mighty Mask and both took on 18 at the same time. Android 18 noticed their great speed and strength and even commented on it, figuring something was going on that she wasn't aware about. Because of Android 18's hyper-advanced technical physiology, she doesn't need to train in order to maintain her power levels.</p><h3>Android 18's Special Techniques</h3><ul><li>Flight (\u98db\u884c, <em>hik\u014d</em>):</li><li>Energy Blast (\u6c17\u7832, <em>kik\u014d</em>):</li><li>Finger Beam (\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0, <em>fing\u0101 b\u012bmu</em>):</li><li>Accel Dance (\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30eb\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9 <em>akuseru dansu</em>):</li><li>Energy Shield (\u6c17\u306e\u30d0\u30ea\u30e4,<em> ki no bariya</em>):</li><li>Sadistic 18 (\u30b5\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af18, <em>sadisutekku j\u016b-hachi</em>):</li><li>High-Pressure Energy Wave (\u9ad8\u5727\u7e2e\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u6ce2, <em>koasshuku enerug\u012b-ha</em>):</li><li>Non-stop Violence (\u30ce\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9, <em>non sutoppu baiorensu</em>):</li><li>Power Blitz (\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4, <em>paw\u0101 burittsu</em>):</li><li>Infinity Bullet (\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u30d0\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8, <em>infiniti baretto</em>):</li><li>Photon Strike (\u30d5\u30a9\u30c8\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af, <em>foton sutoraiku</em>):</li><li>So That's How It Has to Be!

When Trunks returned from the past, he easily destroyed 18 followed by 17.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Anime</h3><h4>Dragon Ball Z (1989)</h4><p>The <i>Dragon Ball Z </i>(\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30ebZ(\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8),<i> <i>Doragon B\u014dru Zetto</i></i>) is the second anime series that's an adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga.

  "description": "<h2>Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</h2><p>Beerus appears in the movie, Dragon ball Z: Battle of Gods, and is the main antagonist of the film. His job is to maintain balance in the 7th universe where Goku and the rest of the Z Fighters reside.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>At times well mannered and occasionally courteous, Beerus has exhibited a deadly short temper, easily angered if things don't go his way. He is shown to destroy planets for petty reasons such as losing in a game of hide and seek, or if deserts aren't shared with him. Though not necessarily <em>evil</em> (destruction is simply his duty, after all), he isn't above making threatening comments when annoyed. He is obsessed with food and other delicacies, with food being one of the reasons he has chosen to spare the earth.</p><h2>Biography</h2><p>Beerus is feared throughout the universe, even by the Gods of Creation/Kais. He usually sleeps for many years and when he awakens he destroys. Since he does not act on orders received from the Supreme Kai's, he would destroy seemingly any world without a second thought. It's implied he also destroys more than what is needed since Toriyama said when the worlds balance begins to crumble, the 4 regular Kai's have to help out the Supreme Kais in creation as well. Once every 1,000 years, the Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction go to each others realms and hold a coordination meeting. During one of these meetings, Beerus sealed away old Kai in the Z Sword after an argument took place among them.</p><p>Beerus at one time mentioned that he came to Earth before and rendered the Dinosaurs extinct since they did not like him. Some 39 years before the events of Battle of Gods, the Prophecy Fish foretold that a strong opponent would appear before him, which was the Super Saiyan God. Beerus recalls having a dream where he fought a Super Saiyan god and that's when he approached the Prophecy Fish about the situation. This sparks a visit to king Kai's place to meet Goku and see if he knew who the Super Saiyan God was. After defeating Goku in his super Saiyan 3 form and the other Z Fighters on Earth, Goku returns to summon Shenron and ask him about legend of Saiyan God. Once the ritual of making the Super Saiyan God was complete, Goku fought somewhat evenly with Beerus and later absorbs the godly transformation's powers into himself. Goku struggled to hold back Beerus energy sphere in space and after transforming into the Super Saiyan God again, Goku erases the energy ball from existence.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3990824\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111136535/3990824-battle_013.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.56354166666667\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111136535/3990824-battle_013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3990824\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111136535/3990824-battle_013.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111136535/3990824-battle_013.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11113/111136535/3990824-battle_013.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111136535/3990824-battle_013.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Although Goku had gained the Super Saiyan God transformation, Beerus proved too much for him to handle in the end, forcing Goku to give up the battle. Beerus defeated Super Saiyan 3 Goku, an enraged Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta, Piccolo, Super Gotenks, Android 18, Tien and Mystic Gohan with relative ease. Such warriors had 5 years of training after the Buu Saga, but even this was not near enough to challenge Beerus' power. Goku himself feared that if he fused with Vegeta he wouldn't be able to overcome the God of Destruction.</p><p>Beerus power was further showcased in Dragon Ball Super, in which the battle between the Destroyer and Super Saiyan God Goku threatened to destroy the universe do to their collective output. Later, Whis compared Goku and Vegeta (who just begun training under Whis) to a small tree in comparison to Beerus, who was a castle. It isn't hard to believe more damage could have been done to the universe had Beerus truly held nothing back against the Saiyan. Even a mostly playful fight between Beerus and fellow God/Twin Brother Champa resulted in many planets and moons being destroyed, with both implying they are willing to destroy the universe to best the other before being incapacitated by their respective attendants.</p><p>Beerus is also a knowledgeable master martial artist, more so than even Goku and Vegeta, to the point where he defeated both and the combined might of the Z-Fighters with mere pressure points. He has made use of his combat skills and godly abilities in combat many times, even creating versatile combinations mid battle, such as creating clones of himself to attack Goku from all angles, infusing Goku's body with Ki to create an explosion like effect, and using advanced forms of Ki manipulation to catch and redirect enemy attacks as he did so against an alien warrior on another planet. Perhaps his best demonstration of power so far was containing and neutralizing an ultra dense Ki sphere created by the clashing of his and Goku's attacks, which was stated to be capable of destroying the universe if it exploded.</p>",

On their adventures they find people like <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a>, <a href=\"/oolong/4005-19776/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19776\">Oolong</a>, <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Master Roshi</a> and others. After many adventures, Bulma eventually stopped seeing Goku. After many years, she sees him again at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai (<a href=\"/world-martial-arts-tournament/4015-56066/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56066\">World Martial Arts Tournament</a>).</p><h3>Dragon Ball Z</h3><p>When the <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-fighters</a> needed to go to planet <a href=\"/namek/4020-57097/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57097\">Namek</a>, Bulma and <a href=\"/mr-popo/4005-45719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45719\">Mr. Popo</a> located a space ship used by <a href=\"/kami/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\">Kami</a> to arrive on Earth. She fixed it up and she went to Namek with the <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Krillin</a> and <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>. During her time there, she miraculously survived the perils of the planet by herself. When her luck finally ran out, she was saved by Gohan.</p><p>Bulma would try her relationship with <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a> again, but to no avail. During this time, she had a relationship with <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and gave birth to their son <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks</a>. While never seemingly close, they had great love for one another.</p><p>During the days when <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Buu</a> was trying to destroy the world, she stood lookout on <a href=\"/kame-sennin/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\">Kami</a>'s lookout for Buu. She eventually was killed by Buu. Later, she was resurrected by the Dragon Balls. Her and Vegeta would have a daughter named <a href=\"/bra/4005-61575/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61575\">Bra</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Bulma is an incredibly brilliant mechanical genius just like her father. Bulma's most famous invention is the <a href=\"/dragon-radar/4055-56021/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56021\">Dragon Radar</a> used to locate the magical <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragon Balls</a>. In the bleak timeline of future Trunks, she designed and built an operating time machine.</p><p>Bulma also seems to have uncanny good luck.</p><p>She doesn't have any superhero powers or abilities but she does know how to operate guns and some weapons. She is no stranger when it comes to using gadgets. In the Dragonball, Dragonball Z, and in the Dragonball movies she is a very respected mechanical and electrical engineer like her father.</p><p>She can repair spaceships, cruisers, and all types of computerized and electrical based gadgets. She is also a very experienced pilot.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Alternate Future Timeline</h3><p>In an alternate future, Goku dies of a heart disease and the evil Androids <a href=\"/android-17/4005-40804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40804\">17</a> &amp; <a href=\"/android-18/4005-40728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40728\">18</a> wreak havoc on the Earth, killing all of the Z-Fighters except Trunks. Bulma is able to build a time machine to send Trunks back in time.</p><p>He is able to not only change the past but train with his father to ascend new levels of power. When he returns to his own time, he is able to destroy the androids as well as <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell </a>and start a new future with his mother. </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

The team consist of Cancellator, <a href=\"../../sweep-zweak/29-75681/\" rel=\"nofollow\">               Sweep-Zweak</a>, <a href=\"../../lead-in/29-9660/\" rel=\"nofollow\">              Lead-In</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9657\" href=\"/deadair/4005-9657/\" slug=\"deadair\">      Deadair</a> and <a href=\"../../timeslot/29-9662/\" rel=\"nofollow\">            Timeslot</a>.  The Death Sponsors are considered the Mergers  and Acquisitions  Department for that pirate network that has  established a solid  demographic audience on a counter-programming basis  against Mojo with  the use of bootleg transmissions. The Death Sponsors  easily dispatch a  bunch of rebels sent by Mojo to destroy their citadel  spire and their  competition. The Spineless One informs the Death  Sponsors that three  potential ratings bonanzas have been left on Earth:  the original  time-dancer, <a href=\"../../spiral/29-9722/\" rel=\"nofollow\">           Spiral</a>, the Fallen Messiah and the geneticist  <a href=\"../../arize/29-9658/\" rel=\"nofollow\">          Arize</a>.  Any of the three would benefit their network and would help   successfully overthrow their network rival, Mojo. The Death Sponsors   travel to Earth and decide to go after Arize. Deadair is able to tune   into the broadcast signal to Arize's location so Timeslot teleports them   to Xavier's Mansion where the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">         X-Men</a>  are protecting the Death Sponsor's  target. A fierce battle takes place  between the two teams and Cancellator engages with various members of the X-Men but most noticeably with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\" href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" slug=\"colossus\">    Colossus</a>. The Death  Sponsors appear to gain the upper hand when Sweep-Zweak uses  his energy  disruption powers to cut off the X-Men's access to their  mutant  abilities. Timeslot performs a cyberlink which allows him to  teleport  his teammates through a electronic mind-link but that link is  disrupted  when Bishop shoots the teleporter during midport. Arize  remains on Earth  while the rest of the Death Sponsors teleport back to  Mojoworld.

  "description": "<h2>Pilaf Saga</h2><p>In a very early episodes of Dragon Ball, Chi-Chi is seen running away from a dinosaur who she later slices his head off with her blade. After wards, she runs into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\" href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\">Yamcha</a>. After getting knocked out unconscious by Yamcha for trying to attack him, he returns to her aid. At first, now awaken, she views Yamcha as a threat. He lies and says he loves her to keep her from hurting him. Because she is naive, she believes him. When she turns her back, Yamcha runs away. Soon she comes across Goku on his Kinto 'un. While trying to ride the Kinto'un (<a data-ref-id=\"4055-56022\" href=\"/flying-nimbus-kintoun/4055-56022/\">Flying Nimbus</a>), <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\" href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\">Goku</a> kicked Chi-Chi's private area to determine her sex (uncut version). Brought up as the only daughter of Gy\u00fb-Ma\u00f4 (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-61744\" href=\"/ox-king/4005-61744/\">Ox-King</a>) and living a secluded life, her face became red and believing very wrongly that Goku liked her (after of course taking offense and kicking Goku who couldn't yet fly off the speeding cloud and then crashing herself). She tells Goku that when she becomes older, he will be the person to take her hand in marriage. A naive Goku agrees, thinking that marriage is some kind of food.</p><h2>Red Ribbon Army Saga</h2><p>She would see Goku again at the beginning of the Red Ribbon Army Saga, when he would visit her to find the Dragon Ball which at the time was being sought by both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61747\" href=\"/pilaf/4005-61747/\">Emperor Pilaf</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61760\" href=\"/colonel-silver/4005-61760/\">Colonel Silver</a> of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-45994\" href=\"/red-ribbon-army/4060-45994/\">Red Ribbon Army</a>, and later she would make a brief filler appearance in the King Piccolo Saga.</p><h2>Piccolo Jr. Saga</h2><p>Years later, Chi-Chi came back, first hiding her name and as an opponent in the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55867\" href=\"/23rd-tenkaichi-budoukai/4045-55867/\">23rd Tenkaichi Bud\u00f4ukai</a>. Chi-Chi is angry that Goku had never came back to keep 'the promise' which Goku, of course, has forgotten about already. She says that if Goku will defeat her in the match, she will tell him what it is about. Goku does and is shocked to realize that little Chi-Chi had grown up as he had. Being a good-natured man, Goku decides to keep his promise and announces that he will marry her, in front of the whole crowd. Afterwards, in the anime-only filler conclusion to the Dragon Ball TV series, they go on several adventures to retrieve the basho-sen (Bansho Fan in Eng. dub) in order to put out the fire on Chi-Chi's mountain home (which was already destroyed in both the manga and anime) to save her father. By the end of Dragon Ball, she and Goku are married.</p><p>After marriage, Chi-Chi became a supporting character to Goku (and the two sons, Son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\" href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\">Gohan</a> and Son <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40745\" href=\"/goten/4005-40745/\">Goten</a>). She is very notable by very emphasizing on the sons' academic achievement rather than their fighting ability, as she was hesitant for Gohan to repeat Goku's habits of getting into danger. Therefore she often becomes frustrated when Goku decides to take the sons (esp. Gohan) to fights, so much that oftentimes Chi-Chi is willing to go to battle herself to defend her sons. Inevitably, Gohan had to work hard on both his human identity as well as his academic skills. In result, the very last chapters of the Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z manga stated that Gohan had become a scholar and thus did not participate the very last Tenkaichi Bud\u00f4kai of Dragon Ball Z.</p><p>Sometime late in the Cell saga, Chi-Chi gives birth to her second son, Goten. Chi-Chi is much more mellow by the time of the Buu Saga. She's not as strict with Goten during the Buu saga and even becomes less strict with a now teenage Gohan. After the Tenka'ichi Budokai, while on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-52288\" href=\"/kamis-lookout/4020-52288/\">Kami's lookout</a>, Chi-Chi and the others are told by Goku of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\" href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\">Vegeta</a> and Gohan's deaths. Chi-Chi takes the news hard and is very upset and angry with Majin Buu when he comes to Kami's hideout. During this time, while on Kami's hideout, Chi-Chi scolds and slaps <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\" href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\">Majin Buu</a> for killing so many people (including Gohan). Thus, she is turned into an egg and killed by Majin Buu, shocking and upsetting Goten. She, along with everyone else killed, is wished back to life. With Goku, now alive again, Chi-Chi is happily reunited with her husband and sons. Her family spent the remainder of Dragon Ball Z in happier, much peaceful times. By the end of Dragon Ball Z, Chi-Chi is now a grandmother to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61593\" href=\"/pan/4005-61593/\">Pan</a> and a mother-in-law to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56825\" href=\"/videl/4005-56825/\">Videl</a> (now married to Gohan) Sister in law to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46397\" href=\"/hercule/4005-46397/\">Mr Satan</a> (Videl's Father).</p><h2>Alternate Timeline</h2><p>Chi-Chi is shown to be alive in the alternate timeline where Future <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\" href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\">Trunks</a> hails from. She has noticeably grown disheveled due to losing her husband to illness and because her son Gohan is off fighting the Androids whenever he gets a chance. She still lives in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-60657\" href=\"/grandpa-gohan/4005-60657/\">Grandpa Gohan</a>'s house and her father the Ox-King visits her often.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h4>Video Games</h4><p>Dragon Ball: Online - Chi-Chi appears as a background character in one of the time traveling missions.</p><p>Dragon Ball: Origins - Chi-Chi appears as a boss</p><p>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 - Chi-Chi appears as a playable character in her child form. As an Adult Chi-Chi narrates all of the characters profiles and gives her opinions about characters, notably calling <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55690\" href=\"/super-saiyan/4015-55690/\">Super Saiyins</a> delinquents.</p><p>Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2 - Adult Chi-Chi appears as a background character.</p><p>Super Dragon Ball Z - Chi-Chi's fighting game debut, she wears the blue gi that she wore for the 23rd <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56066\" href=\"/world-martial-arts-tournament/4015-56066/\">World Martial Arts Tournament</a> and wields the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56737\" href=\"/power-pole/4055-56737/\">Power Pole</a>, Bansho Fan, and flies on the Flying Nimbus.</p>",

  "description": "<h2>Story:</h2><p>Dabura is the king of the demon world and <a href=\"/babidi/4005-51121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51121\">Babidi</a>'s number one in charge. Dabura can turn his victims into stone by spitting on them. He displays this when he fights Gohan. He gives <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> more than a challenge. Dabura is later killed by <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Buu</a> though.</p><p>Dabura is an incredible swordsman too and can gives the best a run for their money. When he's not using his sword he can hold is own with his immense strength, and powers.</p><h2>Personality:</h2><p>Dabura is somewhat cocky. Like most villains he believes he'll have an easy time with his opponents. He seems to like to toy with his enemies.</p><h2>Appearance:</h2><p>Skin: Red with an M engraved on his head from Babidi</p><p>Hair: Black</p><p>Height: around 6'1\"- 6'4\"</p><p>Age: 774</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As the highest powered Demon in Hell Dabura is powerful. He has been vaguely compared to Cell, but failed to defeat SSJ Gohan, which puts his strength up in the air. Dabura has all the basic powers of flight, energy blasts, superhuman strength, durability, and speed, that most DBZ characters posses though he also has some unique powers due to his demon heritage.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Darkness Sword Attack - A rush attack where Dabura flies rapidly into his opponent with his conjured sword slashing repeatedly. After he knocks his opponent back Dabura rushes a second time only to stop and fire and Evil Impulse into his opponents face.</p><p>Evil Flame - Dabura can fire a dark red blast from his mouth that scorches anything in its path.</p><p>Evil Impulse - A large sphere of dark energy fired from one of Dabura's palms. This move is also named the Hell Blitz.</p><p>Magic Materialization - Dabura is able to conjure objects out of thin air to aid him in battle. During his battle with Gohan, Dabura conjured a sword while he made a spear to impale Majin Buu. This power seems to be common among demons as <a href=\"/akkuman/4005-61828/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61828\">Devilman</a> can also conjure a trident.</p><p>Slicing Attack - Dabura makes a swipe with his claws that creates a thin blue energy line that can cut through nearly anything. This is very similar to <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>'s Death Wave attack.</p><p>Stone Spit - Anyone or anything that Dabura spits on will instantly turn to solid stone. This process can only be reversed when Dabura is killed. If the statue breaks then the person dies unless they are able to survive being broken into pieces, like <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>.</p><p>Telepathy - Dabura can communicate via telepathy. He was able to do this with Babadi over a large planetary distance without any of the <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a> noticing.</p>",

Freeza was concerned of an old Saiyan legend, the legend of the Super Saiyan. He saw that a group of low level Saiyans lead by Son Goku's father <a href=\"../../bardock/29-41189/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bardock</a> was completing their missions far more quickly than any of the elite Saiyan warriors and with less trouble. Freeza concluded that at this rate Bardock's team of low level soldiers would become super Saiyans in no time, therefore he decided to exterminate the Saiyan race by blowing up the planet Vegeta.</p><p>Frieza tricks Bardock's team and and sends <a href=\"../../dodoria/29-58122/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dodoria</a> and his team of elite fighters to kill every member of the team although Bardock was in a rejuvenation tank at the time. The moment Bardock arrived on the planet Meat, he was infuriated when he found his best friend Tora lying on the ground dying along with everyone else dead. Bardock took on Dodoria's elite team and beats them only taking a few punches from them but Dodoria was too much for him. Dodoria left him to die, but Bardock was able to escape.</p><p>When Bardock got back to <a href=\"/planet-vegeta/4020-57717/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57717\">planet Vegeta</a>, he warned the others of what was to come, but no one believed him. Therefore Bardock went off to challenge Frieza without recovering from the massive damage he had recieved from Dodorias attack. Bardock was easily defeated when Frieza summoned enough energy to form his Death Ball by his finger alone which destroyed the planet Vegeta along with the entire Saiyan race.</p><h2>Namek and the Dragon Balls</h2><p>Freeza had learned about the <a href=\"../../dragon-balls/18-46445/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dragon Balls</a> from <a href=\"../../vegeta/29-40722/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegeta's</a> scouter. Frieza was collecting the Dragon Balls for one purpose, to receive Immortality so that he could rule the universe for eternity expanding his empire. The competition was fierce between Freeza, Vegeta, and the <a href=\"../../z-fighters/65-41028/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Z-fighters</a>.</p><p>Freeza had no problem collecting all seven Dragon Balls once the <a href=\"../../ginyu-force/65-40742/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ginyu Force</a> had arrived, but could not get them to work because they needed a password that had to be spoken in <a href=\"/namekians/4060-55883/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55883\">Namekian</a>. <a href=\"../../gohan/29-40743/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gohan</a> and <a href=\"../../krillin/29-45683/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Krillin</a> sneak outside to make their wishes without waking Vegeta up, but Vegeta arrives right before they can make their last. Gohan and Krillin manage to wish <a href=\"../../piccolo/29-40727/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Piccolo</a> back, and for him to be brought to the planet Namek. Vegeta manages to persuade Krillin to get <a href=\"../../dende/29-51164/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dende</a> to make Vegeta's wish which was Immortality, but then the Great Elder dies and as his life force is tied to the Dragon Balls, the balls became useless.</p><p>Frieza arrives, and becomes extremely mad, attacking Vegeta who has grown equal in power to Freeza's first form. Vegeta then manages to talk Frieza into transforming since he learned about Frieza's ability to transform from <a href=\"../../zarbon/29-44797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zarbon</a>, Frieza's right hand henchmen. After Freeza transforms, he toys with the Z Warriors. Frieza ends up stabbing Krillin with his horns and then tosses him aside like a piece of trash being thrown away into the water.</p><p>After that Frieza tastes Gohan's powerful energy blasts, but in the end it had not affect whatsoever. After Frieza gets up after all of Gohans powerful blasts, he me says \"hey kid I admit your power does surprise me, but try to get it through your head you're far from being my equal.\" Frieza then toys with Gohan, by crushing his head under his foot. Everything seemed hopeless until Piccolo, who fused with <a href=\"../../nail/29-58242/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nail</a>, arrives.</p><p>Frieza and Piccolo fight and it seemed that Piccolo had the advantage at the time, but it ended up that Frieza was not even trying, Frieza then decides to transform again. Frieza's new form was extremely powerful and made him look like a monster. Frieza easilly outclasses Piccolo in strength and speed, and beats Piccolo by blasting him constantly. If it wasn't for Gohan Piccolo would have died from Frieza's fury. Freeza then transforms into his final form, while Vegeta raises his power level in an \"unconventional\" way by having Kuririn shoot him with a Ki blast and Dende heal him, knowing that Saiyans grow stronger after near-death experiences.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/155678-148971-freeza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-155678\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.77\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/155678-148971-freeza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-155678\"><img alt=\"Freeza's true face\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/155678-148971-freeza.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6342/155678-148971-freeza.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Freeza's true face</figcaption></figure><p>Vegeta attacks Freeza, but soon realizes he is no match for Frieza. When <a href=\"../../goku/29-19765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goku</a> arrives at the battlefield, Frieza was just about to finish Vegeta. Once Vegeta notices Goku's arrival, he tells Goku everything. This included Frieza taking Vegeta away from his father when he was just a little boy and forcing him to do everything that Frieza wanted, and if he didn't Frieza threatened to kill his father. Vegeta tells Goku he did everything Frieza had asked but Frieza killed his father anyway along with everyone else including the entire planet.</p><p>Goku also had trouble fighting Frieza. This in turn causes Goku to believe that Frieza really is the most powerful being in the Universe and that he doesn't have a chance. After taking a huge beating from Frieza, Goku could barely manage to stand up. Goku had no choice but to use the Spirit Bomb which was his last trump card. When Goku was drawing the energy for the Spirit Bomb, he was absorbing the energy from the entire planet along with the entire solar system. Piccolo realizing that Frieza could find out about Goku's attack any time now asked Gohan and Krillin for their energy so he could by some more time for Goku's attack. Once Frieza realizes that their was an enormous ball of energy in the sky, which he thought was the sun, He begins to use finishing attack which he calls his Death Beam to finish off Goku, but Piccolo manages to save him just in time. After Frieza takes a blow from Piccolo, Frieza almost kills Piccolo but then Gohan and Krillen intervene with two energy waves. Frieza then summons his Death Ball which can easily wipe out the entire planet.</p><p>Then Goku realizes that the Spirit Bomb is complete and uses it on Frieza. Frieza feels the Spirit Bomb and tries to control it, but it was too powerful to be controlled. After Goku's attack, Gohan, Krillin, Goku, and Piccolo assumed Frieza was dead because no one has ever survived the Spirit Bomb before. The Z Warriors begin to celebrate, but their celebration was cut short after Krillin first realizes that Frieza was still alive and eager for revenge. An infuriated uses his finishing attack on Goku, but Piccolo intervenes and knocks Goku down and saves his life by sacrificing himself. Piccolo wasn't dead but was dying. Frieza then uses his telekinetic powers to lift Krillin up into the air, and then blows him up from the inside. As a result of Piccolo's near death, and the death of his best friend Krillin, Goku transforms into the legendary <a href=\"/super-saiyan/4015-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55690\">Super Saiyan</a>.</p><p>Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan, and after a lengthy battle, ends up obliterating Freeza. Freeza is left to die as <a href=\"/namek/4020-57097/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57097\">Namek</a> blows up, but Freeza survives even this.</p><h2>Trunks Saga</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/20634/394175-49734-freeza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-394175\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4215384615385\" data-width=\"325\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 325px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/20634/394175-49734-freeza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-394175\"><img alt=\"Frieza's Death\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" data-width=\"325\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/20634/394175-49734-freeza.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/20634/394175-49734-freeza.jpg 325w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Frieza's Death\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/20634/394175-49734-freeza.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/20634/394175-49734-freeza.jpg 325w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px\" data-width=\"325\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Frieza's Death</figcaption></figure><p>His father, <a href=\"/king-cold/4005-45782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45782\">King Cold</a>, finds him floating in space and has his men gather him up, and attach cyber-prosthetics which raise his power level. King Cold and Freeza then travel to Earth to take revenge on Goku. Upon arriving, Freeza commands his army to find and kill Goku's friends to anger Goku when he arrives on Earth. They are stopped when Trunks arrives and takes them all out. Trunks then has a short fight with Freeza, ending when <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks</a> cuts Freeza in two down the middle.

They head to Earth and wish the space tyrant from his death using the dragonballs. Frieza returns from being trapped in hell, but is brought back in pieces from his death at the hands of Trunks. They place the pieces of Frieza in a rejuvenation chamber and he returns. Upon awakening Frieza is disdained at what has become of his once feared army. He blows a hole in the spaceship, killing several of the remaining soldiers. Frieza wishes revenge upon the saiyans and comes to the realization that at one point he was one of the strongest beings in the universe but never trained a day in his life. He decides to train for a couple months in order to surpass a super saiyan. Upon returning to Earth, he sets loose his army in wait for Goku to show up.</p><p>He kills a super saiyan Gohan in a single punch by stopping his heart. Goku returns and Frieza immediately goes into his final form. Frieza is on the losing end of a struggle with Goku and decides to enter his new form, one he dubs as \"Golden Frieza.\" Goku enters a new Super Saiyan Blue transformation himself, a product of learning how to use God Ki, and the two battle. Frieza seems to gain the upper hand, but eventually his power starts waning. It is suggested he learned a new form and didn't give his body a chance to get used to it and he burns through its power. Frieza uses a backup plan as Sorbet sneak attacks Goku with a laser through the heart, nearly killing him. Vegeta steps and powers up to his own God Form and attacks the tyrant. Receiving enough damage, Frieza is beat back into his final form. While at the mercy of Vegeta, in a desperate attempt to kill the saiyans, he destroys the Earth. Whis provides a shield for a few survivors and uses his powers to rewind just before Frieza blew up the planet, Goku jumps in and kills Frieza, sending the galactic emperor to hell once more.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968891-frieza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968891\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3793103448276\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968891-frieza.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968891\"><img alt=\"Frieza\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968891-frieza.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968891-frieza.jpg 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Frieza\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968891-frieza.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/968891-frieza.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Frieza</figcaption></figure><p>Freeza was at one time the most powerful fighter in the universe. Freeza's unnamed race has the natural ability to change their form to conform and conserve their power level. Freeza has telepathy though cannot focus on characters energy signatures so he most keep them in eye sight or risk losing tack of them. After a prolonged battle Freeza can lock his senses onto a person and know there given position at anytime. Freeza's mental power also extends to telekinesis allowing him to throw boulders at his opponents or blast them back with psychic energy. Freeza in his final form can extend his tail great distances and retract it at will, his tail is articulate enough to strangle his opponent and powerful enough to be substituted for a kick or punch. Freeza's body is extrordinarly durable and can survive massive punishment as well as survive in the vacuum of space. Freeza was heavily injured though lived through the Planet Namek exploding while he was on it even though he has lost his legs, tail, and an arm during his battle with Goku.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Crazy Finger Beam - One of Freeza's more malicious move, where he repeatedly fires small finger blasts at his opponent very quickly. The balsts are not very powerful, but the speed at which they hit and the great number of them cause a high amount of damage.</p><p>Death Ball - One of Freeza's signature attacks, He forms a small yellow ball from the tip of his index finger which quickly grows in size to dwarf even his personal space ship. This is the attack he used to destroy both Planet Vegeta and Planet Namek.</p><p>Death Beam - Freeza's most used attack, a purple beam fired from his index finger. The attacks is quick and precise allowing Freeza to control his energy output. While quick the move is deadly and able to pierce armor and skin easily.</p><p>Death Cannon - Larger variant of the Death Beam, the Death Cannon is fired from both palms and is reminiscent of the Kamehameha Wave.</p><p>Death Wave - Freeza fires a thing beam from his two fingers that is designed to cut a target in half.</p><p>Hell Bazooka - A move used in conjunction with Cell. They emit yellow energy from there bodies which incase an opponent allowing them to drag them to the deepest parts of <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">hell</a>.</p><p>Flaming Cannon - Freeza is able to shoot a large column of flame at his opponent.</p><p>Eye Laser - A simple and precise attack that is often used to nullify bigger attacks or to attack an opponent quickly.</p><p>Homing Death Saucer - Freeza's variant of the destructo disk that can be directed mentally around the battlefield. Freeza can command at least two at a time though he is not immune to them himself.</p><p>Hail Frieza - In his second form, Frieza rushes towards his opponent and pierces the chest with his horn. He then moves his head around and throws his opponent away before damaging them with a powerful purple beam.</p><p>Imprisonment Light-Ball - A special attack used for torture where Freeza imprisons his target inside a sphere of yellow energy and then can proceed to beat them mercilessly. When the sphere touches anything that is not Freeza it will explode killing whoever is inside of it.</p><p>Nova Strike - Freeza surrounds himself in a purple energy sphere and rams himself into his opponent to cause damage.</p><p>Telekinesis - Freeza is able to move objects around with his mind. He usually will throw things around the battlefield against his opponent.</p><p>Transformation - Freeza can go through a series of transformations to unlock his ultimate power.</p><h3>Forms</h3><ul><li>First form</li><li>Second form</li><li>Third form</li><li>Final form</li><li>100% Power</li><li>Mecha frieza</li><li>Ultimate evolution</li></ul>",

She developed her powers while under pressure from her father to succeed. Emma blackmailed her father after he got a professor who she was romantically linked with fired. Despite her father being upset, he decided she was smart and offered her to take over the family business, but Emma declined preffering to make her fortune herself. Emma left her family and joined the radical mutant group, the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>. After spending a stint as the \u201cWhite Queen,\u201d she later defected to the X-Men to lead the team.</p><p><strong>Frost International</strong></p><p>Emma, using her telepathic powers, good looks, and charm, eventually came to be the majority stockholder in a multibillion dollar conglomerate that would later become known as Frost International, after its CEO, Miss Emma Frost. The company specialized in the advancement of various technologies. electronics, and transportation. Frost International was so successful that Emma quickly became very rich, and was later involved in the Hellfire Club. Unfortunately, Emma decided to liquidate her company's funds in order to bankroll the mutant island of Utopia \"... for the forseeable future\". The current state of her company is unknown, as of now.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Emma Frost was created by writer <a href=\"/chris-claremont/4040-40468/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40468\">Chris Claremont</a> and artist/co-writer <a href=\"/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\">John Byrne </a>and first appeared in <a href=\"../../the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uncanny X-Men #129 </a>(1980).</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Emma Frost has transitioned from one of the X-Men's deadliest foes into a central figure on the side of the mutants. Her first era presented her as a leader in the Hellfire Club, but this ended when the manic time traveler <a href=\"../../trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fitzroy</a> appeared from the future, resulting in the deaths of many of her Hellions and putting Emma into a coma. Her involvement in the <a href=\"../../phalanx-covenant/39-42176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phalanx Covenant</a> arc led her to becoming co-teacher of the new <a href=\"../../generation-x/65-15083/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Generation X</a> team with <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a>. Later, after the end of the Generation X series, when the Sentinels devastated Genosha she gained a new power - her diamond form. Subsequent story arcs made her Cyclops' new partner and lover, and a former co-leader of the X-Men. She continues to play a prominent role in Cyclops' teams.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Hellfire Club</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/165357-59115-emma-frost.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/165357-59115-emma-frost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4226/165357-59115-emma-frost.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Emma first encounters the X-men while she is the \u201cWhite Queen\u201d of the dangerous Hellfire Club. She tries to forcibly recruit <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitty Pryde</a> to the club, but was opposed by the X-Men. Though Emma is initially triumphant, the X-Men eventually defeats her. She and her mutant students, the <a href=\"../../hellions/65-3199/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hellions</a> would encounter the X-Men many times after this. Her time with the Hellfire Club ends when she is attacked by a mad time traveler named <a href=\"../../trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>. In the ensuing incident which also involved the X-Men, most of the Hellions are killed, and Emma in sent into a coma. She is eventually revived, although her mind is transferred to Bobby Drake's body. Initially Emma thought Xavier is holding her hostage, so she flees to Frost International - still in <a href=\"../../iceman/29-1464/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iceman's</a> body. Accessing one of her computers, Emma discovers her Hellions were dead and blames herself for it.</p><p>When Xavier and some other X-Men finally catch up with her, Frost confesses to Charles that the only reason she fights him over young mutants was that she believes that she could offer them something Xavier can\u2019t, and that their deaths proves that she was wrong. Emma then agrees to go back to the X-Mansion and have her mind transferred back to her body.</p><h3>Generation X</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78357/1966355-children_present.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78357/1966355-children_present.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"Emma forming Generation X\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78357/1966355-children_present.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emma forming Generation X\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78357/1966355-children_present.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emma forming Generation X</figcaption></figure><p>While Emma Frost recides in the X-Mansion after her body transfer, she and the rest of the X-Men encounter the evil Phalanx, humans possessed by the transmode virus. The Phalanx ultimate goal was to use the young new mutants that where born in their evil scheme. Emma and fellow X-Man Banshee take it upon themselves to find these new mutants before they are captured by the Phalanx. Thus creating an all new team of mutants, which would later become known as Generation X. Emma tries to fight off the Phalanx, but was not strong enough so she combines the powers of Synch and Jubilee. Later, During Generation X's training, Emma's sister Adrienne tries to create chaos at the institute. She plants bombs which are not defused in time, and in a rage Emma shoots and kills her sister. After a while, Emma has visions and is haunted by the past of her sister, but she is able to defeat her once again and expel her from her mind. From that point on she vows not to rely on her telepathic abilities. In her opinion it had caused her to lose her edge resulting in Synch's death, and she vows to be hard \"as hard as diamonds.\"</p><h3>Joining the X-Men</h3><p>After this, she goes on to teach at the mutant-dominated island nation of <a href=\"../../genosha/34-40967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha</a>. During the infamous <a href=\"../../sentinels/65-4296/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinel</a> Genocide of the island\u2019s inhabitants, Emma manages to survive by virtue of her secondary mutation manifesting, allowing her to take on a near-invulnerable diamond form. She finds herself as one of the instructors at Xavier\u2019s, where she develops a close relationship with X-Men founding member <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>. This would evolve into a secretive telepathic affair between the two, helped along by an incident where Cyclops temporarily becomes possessed by <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a>. <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean</a>\u2019s discovery of this would distance her own relationship with Cyclops, while Emma would only grow closer to the mutant leader.</p><h3>New X-Men</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1894136-new_x_men___121____nuff_said___silence___psychic_rescue_in_progress___02___03.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1894136-new_x_men___121____nuff_said___silence___psychic_rescue_in_progress___02___03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1894136-new_x_men___121____nuff_said___silence___psychic_rescue_in_progress___02___03.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38880/1894136-new_x_men___121____nuff_said___silence___psychic_rescue_in_progress___02___03.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Emma had been teaching on the mutant island kingdom of Genosha when Cassandra Nova launched a massive sentinel attack. The attack wiped out the population of the island. Jean Grey and Hank McCoy traveled to Genosha to help with relief efforts, and discovered only one survivor - Emma Frost. She'd been saved by the manifestation of her secondary mutation, a flexible, organic diamond form. In her arms, she held the corpse of her former student, <a href=\"/ellie-phimister/4005-41178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41178\">Negasonic Teenage Warhead</a>, unwilling to accept that she'd died. Emma was taken back to the Xavier Institute so that Beast could run a few tests on her new mutation. He concluded that she'd been gifted with diamond skin. Unfortunately, when in diamond form, Emma discovered that she could no longer access her telepathy. In this form, she could not experience genuine emotion or pain. After telepathically summoning a taxi, Emma planned to leave the Institute, but she said she had an \"epiphany\", and decided to stop the car and head back to the school. She entered as the other X-Men were battling Cassandra Nova. In her diamond form, Emma twisted Nova's neck, killing her, saying that \"There are just some things that shouldn't be forgiven.\" However, Nova had a type of healing factor that kicked in and brought her back. Unbeknownst to the X-Men, Nova had switched places with Xavier by means of a consciousness transfer. Nova now occupied the body of Xavier. As Xavier, she shot her own true body to cripple the real Charles. Cyclops thanks Emma for coming back. Emma plays this off, saying that she'd forgotten her bag, and it was lucky for Scott that it was a Louis Vitton. After this event, Emma decides to join the X-Men.</p><h3>Xorn</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8134/218139-108213-emma-frost.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>On a trip to China, the group came upon a captive mutant called Xorn. In an effort to free him, the X-Men battled Chinese militants and John Sublime's U-Men. Eventually, Xorn was free of captivity. Disgusted with the life he knew, he was attempting to overload his powers, which would destroy life on Earth. Emma used her telepathy to psychically \"download\" the Chinese language into Cyclops's mind. Scott was able to talk Xorn down, and even offered him a place on the X-Men.</p><p>Soon later, Xavier (which was still really Cassandra Nova) outed himself as a mutant on a live talk show. Many reacted to this in a negative way, and soon a large crowd formed outside the school, comprised of protesters, mutant-haters, and the media. Xavier (Nova) decided to visit Charles's lady love, the Empress Lilandra Neramani of the Shi'ar Empire. He left the planet, leaving the team to deal with the new students, the protesters, and Sublime. Jean tried addressing the crowd, but her efforts bore no fruit. Emma, tired of waiting around for Jean's method to work, telepathically brought every member of the crowd to orgasm, simultaneously. They each passed out, and when they woke up, they left in their shame.</p><h3>Visiting Sublime</h3><p>Emma and Scott decided to pay a visit to John Sublime, who'd been preaching to the world that everyone could be a mutant. Despite his seemingly wannabe-attitude, Emma believed he was involved in a plot far more sinister. When questioned by the pair, Sublime had his U-Men attack Emma and Scott. One of them broke Emma's nose. She shifted into diamond form, unable to telepathically shut them down because she was being blocked by the captive <a href=\"/no-girl/4005-41121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41121\">Martha Johansson </a>who would go on to become No-Girl. Emma and Scott were detained. The U-Men were given orders to sever Scott's head from his body. They were to later turn their attention to Emma to take her apart and make some sort of human chandelier out of her. While they were occupied with Scott, Emma broke free of her restraints and angrily took down her opponents, freeing Scott in the process. They located Sublime once again in his office. Emma telepathically stimulated the man's pain receptors so that he could feel what she felt when her nose was broken, but amplified to an unbearable degree. Emma then attacked him, slamming him into the large windows, breaking the glass when she did so. She held him several stories above the ground, threatening to drop him. Scott urged her not to, reminding her that X-Men don't kill. Sublime let go of Emma, falling to the his death. Emma told Scott not to blame her as \"he practically somersaulted\" from her grip.</p><p>Cassandra Nova had been using her influence in the Shi'ar Empire to return to Earth with a host of Shi'ar destroyers. It was revealed that she had unleashed thousands of nano sentinels into the air at the Xavier Institute, infecting the X-Men. She then lied to the Superguardians, telling them that this mutant plague was contagious and needed to be wiped out before it harmed everyone else in the galaxy. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard attacked the Institute. Emma was taken out first so that her formidable telepathic powers would not interfere with their invasion. A device was placed on her head that prevented her from using her powers. As the Superguardians battled their way into the school, Emma was stuck, powerless on the campus. Fortunately for her, the Stepford Cuckoos were able to psychically learn how to unlock the device. They helped Emma out of her constraints, and she headed back to the mansion, where an understanding between the X-Men and the Imperial Guard had been reached. Unfortunately, Cassandra Nova did not halt her attack, still using Xavier's body. All hope seemed lost until Emma returned and tricked Nova into making a deal with her. Emma would provide Nova with a host body if Nova let her live. Nova agreed and entered the body of the alien, Stuff, who was a gelatinous blob programmed for learning basic things, meaning Nova would be trapped in the body of an unintelligent, incompetent alien blob.</p><h3>Riot at Xavier's</h3><p>Later on, <a href=\"/quentin-quire/4005-40583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\">Quentin Quire</a> aka Kid Omega, the prized pupil of Charles Xavier, and his gang of cronies known as the Omega Gang attacked and inhibited the powers of Professor X. Unable to use his telepathy, the man tried to talk some sense into the students, who'd hooked him up on the wall. They were determined to ruin the school's Open Day the next morning by staging a riot. When crowds of humans arrived to see the wonderful displays the students had created for the school, Quentin made statements about the lies of Xavier and the superiority of mutantkind. <a href=\"/glob-herman/4005-40586/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40586\">Glob Herman</a> was lit on fire, and he began to hurl balls of flame at the crowds. Emma assumed her diamond form and helped get the humans packed onto buses and away from the dangerous Omega Gang. Quentin had already managed to subdue Wolverine and Professor X. Glob Herman, still aflame, chased the bus of humans, drawing the attention of Beast. Cyclops engaged the Omega Gang, easily taking down several members. A member known as Tattoo phased her hand through Scott's head, threatening to solidify, thereby killing him. Emma slid her diamond hand through Tattoo's own head, saying that if Tattoo solidified, she would die as well. She was able to eliminate <a href=\"/tattoo/4005-18499/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18499\">Tattoo</a> as a threat. Meanwhile, the Stepford Cuckoos used the powers of their hive mind while Sophie Cuckoo used the drug known as Kick and Cerebra to enhance their powers. Together they were able to subdue Quentin, but at a price. Emma had gone to check on Sophie. She carried the girl's dead body to the outside of the school. The psychic strain had killed Sophie Cuckoo.</p><h3>Psychic Affair Outed</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55540/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55540/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55540/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55540/2838529-tumblr_mbk9glpzjt1ry3u3oo1_500.png\"></noscript></a></figure><p>As Jean Grey was returning on a flight back to Westchester from her European missions with new mutant <a href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\">Sooraya Qadir</a>, aka Dust, the Stepford Cuckoos contacted her, informing her that her husband, Scott, had been having a psychic affair with Emma Frost. The Cuckoos were mad that under Emma's tutelage, Sophie had decided to play the hero and died for it. This was their way of getting revenge. Scott and Emma were in the middle of their psychic tryst when Jean Grey returned, and burst into Emma's thoughts, catching them in the act. Scott tries to explain, but Jean shuts him out, and gets personal with Emma. She forces her way into Emma's mind, and they argue, while Jean explores the depths of Emma's psyche, looking for memories Emma has been keeping well hidden. After invading Emma's mind and stomping around in it, Jean leaves, and Emma falls into Wolverine's arms, admitting finally and lamenting that she has fallen in love with Scott Summers. Beast goes to check on her later on, only to discover, to his shock and dismay, that Emma has been shot and shattered into thousands of little diamond shards. Veteran X-Men Lucas Bishop and Sage arrive on the scene to investigate Emma Frost's murder. They lock down the school and begin questioning everyone. It is later revealed that Angel Salvadore had confronted Emma Frost and shot her in her nose (the flawed weak point of her diamond form), thereby shattering her. Just before this diamond bullet was fired, Emma realized that Esme Cuckoo had been controlling Angel and had forced her to shoot Emma. Hank McCoy busied himself with reassembling Emma's diamond form in his lab, as if it were a giant puzzle. When he was nearing completion, Jean decided to step in and used her Phoenix powers to piece Emma back together and fuse all the shards. Emma was alive again, and the first thing she did was shout out the name of Esme. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was attempting to escape the school. She easily defeated them telepathically, and then left the premises in a cab. It was revealed that Esme had been dealing the drug Kick at the school, and had gotten rid of Emma because she had been investigating it. Sooner or later, she would have discovered that Esme was behind it all. Esme had been using Kick to enhance her telepathy so that she could take total control of the hive mind she shared with the other Stepford Cuckoos. Sophie attempted to fight back, and because of that, Esme influenced Sophie's brash heroism during the riot at the school, thereby steering Sophie to her death. It was not Emma's fault, after all.</p><h3>Co-leader of the X-Men</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2831877-house_of_m__1___page_10.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Jean\u2019s death at the hands of <a href=\"../../xorn/29-3183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xorn</a>, Emma makes her romantic relationship with Cyclops public, despite the disapproval of others . After this she becomes co-headmaster of the newly rebuilt <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute</a>. Emma soon begins playing a pivotal role in the lives of the students. Emma becomes the head of a team of a students that she called the Hellions, after her former fallen pupils. Emma also joins the new premier X-Men team, consisting of Cyclops, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitty Pryde</a>, and <a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beast</a>. When the <a href=\"/danger/4005-40862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40862\">Danger Room</a> becomes sentient, Emma battles it with the other members of her team. Emma is the last one standing, and is unable to defeat her. Later while battling Danger on Genosha, Emma reconnects with the Hellfire Club.</p><h3>Messiah Complex</h3><p>Emma was with the team when they visited Cooperstown, Alaska to find the newborn Hope Summers. They searched for survivors as they looked upon the carnage that the Marauders and the Purifiers had left in their wake. Emma used her telepathy to scan for survivors. The baby Hope was missing, and the X-Men believed Mr. Sinister's Marauders had taken her. In an effort to find her, a team of five - Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, &amp; Angel - was dispatched to confront the Marauders. Sinister, believing that taking down the team would be simple, was surprised to find that there was a sixth X-Man with them: though her body was back at the mansion, Emma was psychically present, shielding the minds of the X-Men against Sinister's telepathy. When the Sentinels that stood guard over the school were hijacked by Bishop (unbeknownst to the team), Emma's concentration was broken, and the team became susceptible to Sinister's attacks. Emma was also with the team later on when they battled the Marauders, and took down Harpoon. During the battle on Muir Island, Emma psychically engaged Exodus, and the two battled telepathically. Though Exodus was capable of other feats (telekinesis, etc.), Emma was able to keep him so completely focused on their psi-battle that he was unable to use his other abilities on her. While Emma kept him distracted, Dust entered his body one grain of sand at a time, and scoured his lungs, incapacitating the mutant, while the rest of the X-Men finished off the remaining Marauders.</p><h3>House of M &amp; M Day</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4175743\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.48428571428571\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4175743\"><img alt=\"Put her down.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg 700w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Put her down.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg 700w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4175743-4251507502-house.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Put her down.</figcaption></figure><p>After the reality warp caused by the Scarlet Witch, Emma Frost was married to Scott Summers and the couple had three children. Emma was the first person Wolverine contacted when he discovered that reality had been altered by Wanda. Once \"reawakened\", Emma was able to use her telepathy to restore the memories of others, thereby \"reawakening\" them as well. After a significant number of heroes, both X-Men and Avengers, had their memories restored, a meeting was held to discuss what should be done regarding the Scarlet Witch. Speaking to this issue, Emma said, \"What is their to say? Put her down\". Emma was the only one who agreed with Logan - the Scarlet Witch needed to be killed. A large group of X-Men and Avengers traveled to Genosha to deal with the Scarlet Witch. Wanda was driven to the edge, and in this final moment of madness, she uttered the words \"No more mutants\" deactivating the x-gene of mutants all over the world, thereby significantly decreasing the mutant population from hundreds of thousands to mere hundreds. Emma had been monitoring the battle via Cerebro, and upon the utterance of those words, Emma witnessed thousands of lights representing mutants suddenly go out. She was among the few mutants who still retained their powers after M Day.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>When the full forces of the Skrull Empire invaded Earth, a portion of those troops traveled to San Francisco, believing the population there to be devoid of any superhuman presence. But they were wrong. At the time, San Francisco was still the home of the X-Men, and among them was Emma Frost.</p><h3><a href=\"/utopia/4045-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55905\">Utopia</a> and<b> <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a></b></h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2850286\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2850286-secret_invasion__8___page_22.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.77319587628866\" data-width=\"1940\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2850286-secret_invasion__8___page_22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2850286\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 1940w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 1940w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Emma is called upon by <a href=\"../../norman-osborn/29-58812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Norman Osborn</a>, after he is appointed as America's \"Top Cop\", to join a group named the <a href=\"/cabal/4060-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56051\">Cabal</a> to help Osborn consolidate power.

She later leaves this post to fight with the other X-Men on the Golden Gate Bridge. She acted very nervous when Hope manifested the Phoenix Force, but she was told by Wolverine that there is nothing she can do now. She acts cold and unconcerned towards Scott when he seeks her out for moral support due to being in this form. She then sees the Phoenix Force manifest around <a href=\"../../hope-summers/29-49329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hope</a> and remembers <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey's</a> words to her when she saw her during the Sisterhood attack: \"Prepare\".</p><h3><a href=\"/fear-itself/4045-56288/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56288\">Fear Itself</a></h3><p>Emma and the other X-Men are forced to protect the city of San Francisco from Kuurth, Unstoppable Juggernaut. After creating a psychic conference room for the mayor, Cyclops, and herself; Emma waits on Cerebro to attack the Juggernaut mentally when the team can get his helmet off. Once his helmet is off, Emma tries to attack telepathically but suffers extreme psychic distress. She is sent to the recovery center on Utopia alongside Hope Summers, who, in a moment of confusion, she tries to suffocate. She is stopped by Namor who she mistakes for Cyclops and kisses him by accident, only to snap back to her senses and shoo him away telling him to never tell Scott about this. Namor continues to tell Emma that Scott is undeserving of her love, and that he would make a far more suitable partner.</p><h3>Curse of the Mutants</h3><p>Emma was present when Xarus's united vampire nation attacked various parts of San Francisco. Jubilee was targeted by a vampire suicide bomber, and was thusly transformed into a vampire, herself. The plan was to lure Logan aka Wolverine out to track her down and save her. According to Scott's plan, Logan's healing factor was temporarily negated and he turned into a vampire as well. Emma suggested finding the deceased Dracula, and reanimating him so that he might take down Xarus for them. Namor retrieved Dracula's head and Storm and Gambit were dispatched to find the body. Once put back together, Dracula threatened to simply attack Utopia himself. Eventually, Xarus led a full-scale attack on Utopia, which was defended by the \"Tough Skin\" squad, led by Cyclops, Emma, and Blade, the vampire hunter. Assuming her diamond form, Emma was able to effectively battle the vampire hordes because they could not bite her or do any damage. The sheer numbers of Xarus's legion soon overwhelmed the X-Men, and as they prepared to fall back, the vampire Wolverine was sent to kill Scott. It was then that Scott's plan played out, as Logan's healing factor was restored, and he returned to normalcy. Dracula's arrival saw Emma's plan play out, as father killed son, and the X-Men were able to send the vampires back to where they came from, relatively unscathed.</p><h3>Schism</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4275486\" data-ratio=\"0.47218788627936\" data-width=\"809\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 809px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:47.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4275486\"><img alt=\"Emma &amp; Quentin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg 809w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emma &amp; Quentin\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg 809w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4275486-3529923994-19345.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emma &amp; Quentin</figcaption></figure><p>When Scott Summers and Wolverine visited the United Nations to speak at an International Arms Control Conference, they were surprised to find another mutant in attendance: <a href=\"/quentin-quire/4005-40583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\">Quentin Quire</a>, aka Kid Omega. Quentin used his vast psychic powers to force the world leaders in the room to reveal their deepest darkest secrets on live television. This incident sparked worldwide outrage and widespread panic. Mutant hysteria was at an all time high as world leaders took old models of Sentinels that had been commissioned long ago out of storage. The Sentinels in nearly every country had been reactivated, and were on the lookout for mutants. Emma Frost broadcast a telepathic message to every remaining mutant on the planet, warning them about the sentinels, and urging them to lay low. Emma also ran telepathic surveillance with the Stepford Cuckoos as teams were deployed into the field to destroy the sentinels. The old models began to malfunction and began attacking everyone around them - not just humans. Soon thereafter, Quentin Quire turned up on Utopia seeking sanctuary. Wolverine decided against it, but Cyclops allowed him to stay. He was sent to a room, but not without a stern warning from Emma. While most X-Men were out dealing with the sentinel problem, Emma decided to visit the Museum of Mutant History located elsewhere in San Francisco on the night of its grand opening. The mutant-friendly Mayor Sinclair had invited Cyclops to the event. Cyclops decided to send the <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Sub-Mariner</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>, and <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto </a>with Emma as a show of force to the outside world. While at the museum, Emma notes that she is mentioned barely four times, and in three of them, as a villain. Later, after taking photos, Emma and the X-Men are attacked by Kade Kilgore, his Inner Circle, and their henchmen. Emma's telepathy is blocked by a device activated by <a href=\"/maximilian-von-katzenelnbogen/4005-80676/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80676\">Maximilian Frankenstein</a> of Kilgore's Inner Circle. He reveals there is a tiny button hidden away in his glove by his pinkie finger that allowed him to block her powers. Emma simply breaks his finger, reactivating her telepathic powers. Before she has the ability to shut down the invaders, a space slug is attached to her face, incapacitating Emma and the others. With the 'heavy hitters' down, Idie Okonkwo aka <a href=\"/oya/4005-73388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73388\">Oya</a>, decides, based on Cyclops's orders, to attack the intruders. She burns them alive, all except for Kilgore and his Inner Circle, who escape. This attack sets Wolverine off against Cyclops, saying that it wasn't right for Oya to do what she did. Wolverine blamed Scott, and Scott accepted the blame. By the time the slug was removed from Emma's face, Cyclops and Wolverine had taken down a mega-sentinel that attacked Utopia - with the help of the mutant children.</p><p>This final battle was what made up Logan's mind. He decided to leave Utopia saying that Cyclops was turning children into soldiers. Scott and Logan invited the rest of the mutants to make up their mind, and choose a side, and reassured them that there would be no hard feelings. Cyclops naturally assumed that Emma would stay on Utopia with him. Emma told him he shouldn't have assumed as much. She revealed that he has forced her to sacrifice everything she believes in, everything she loves to be with him on Utopia. She believed in teaching the next generation, not in fighting. After explaining why she <em>should</em> leave, Emma reveals that she liquidated her company in order to bankroll Utopia, since Angel would be leaving. She did it even before Scott asked if she would be staying, showing that she'd already resolved to remain with him.</p><h3><a href=\"/regenesis/4045-56644/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56644\">Regenesis</a></h3><p>Emma stays with Scott on Utopia where she liquidates her company in order to bankroll Utopia for the time being. She is on Scott's Extinction Team along with Hope, Colossus, Magik, Danger, Magneto, Namor and Storm.

They engage him in battle and Emma ends up losing one of her diamond arms due to a blast from a celestial probe. Emma and the team fought the Sinister people until Mr. Sinister invites them into to his domain. Sinister telepathically controlls the team, but due to being in her diamond form Emma is immune but surrounded. Emma told Hope a code word that replicates Emma's diamond form to protect Hope from Sinister prior to entering his domain. With Sinister shot through the head by Hope thanks to Emma, the team is freed from his telepathic control but Sinister predicts this would happen and the team learns Sinister's copies have become a hive-mind like species.</p><p>Emma and the team continue to battle the Sinister Species when Emma realizes that Sinister is using Cyclop's mind as a blueprint for his species. Emma has Namor hold her left arm as a tourniquet and abandons her diamond form where she successfully uses her telepathy to mind blast the Sinisters. However a new Sinister arrives saying he integrated the new data that the previous Sinisters received and shoots himself after teleporting his palace away.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2139595\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.27551020408163\" data-width=\"882\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 882px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:27.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2139595\"><img alt=\"Making The Gods Blink\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg 882w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Making The Gods Blink\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg 882w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2139595-stare.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Making The Gods Blink</figcaption></figure><p>The Dreaming Celestial's head reattaches to it's body as the rest of the Celestials land.

A group of people gather looking at the X-men but they do nothing, no throwing things, no derogatory slurs. They only show fear which was Cyclops' initial plan all along.

He then uses a pheromone barrage on her and Namor forcing them to become intimate on the battlefield which makes Scott angry and jealous causing him to blast Unit. With Unit's eventual defeat at the hands of Danger, the team returns home where Emma apologizes to Scott about what happened with her and Namor. He tells her that he was alright with what happened since she was forced to do so and had no choice in the matter.</p><h3><a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2389208\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4406991260924\" data-width=\"801\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 801px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2389208\"><img alt=\"Phoenix Five\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-width=\"444\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg 801w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg 666w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg 444w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Phoenix Five\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg 801w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg 666w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2389208-avengers_vs_x_men_005__282012_29__28digital_29__28zone_empire___29___page_23.jpg 444w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-width=\"444\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Phoenix Five</figcaption></figure><p>Emma sides with the X-Men where she tried to take Hope deeper into Utopia away from the Avengers and the battle. She was close to telepathically shutting down the the Avenger's mental defenses when Iron Man shows up using a nanotech taser cloud to block her telepathy. Emma is forced into her diamond form and after a brief battle with Iron Man is defeated shortly after until Magneto shows up to battle Iron Man, saving her. After the Avengers have soundly won the Battle of Utopia and Hope has run off, Cyclops surrenders the X-Men. The Avengers become aware that this is just a ruse, as Cyclops has Magik teleport the X-Men away. Emma is with Scott when he visits the Jean Grey School to ask for recruits and sanctuary. A brief battle with Wolverine's X-Men ensues, and the Extinction Team leaves the premises. They find out Hope is heading to the moon. Emma, and four other mutants, Cyclops, Magik, Colossus,and Namor, acquire a shard of the Phoenix thanks to Iron Man using a new armor to stop it from bonding with Hope. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five take Hope back to Earth in order to prepare for future events. They announce they will cleanse the Earth.</p><p>Emma and the rest of the <a href=\"/phoenix-five/4060-59234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59234\">Phoenix Five</a> fix the Earth by ending hunger, providing an unlimited source of free, clean energy and water, and also outlaw war 'Pax Utopia'. In order to outlaw war, they destroy all large weapons including sentinels, missiles, submarines, tanks, etc. Emma destroyed sentinels from all around the world. In order to complete this job, she arrived at Avengers Academy to destroy the sentinel belonging to <a href=\"/juston-seyfert/4005-41669/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41669\">Juston</a>. Despite its being a killing machine, Juston has grown attached to the sentinel and refuses to let Emma destroy it. The students of the Academy step in to prevent Emma from taking the sentinel apart. Hank Pym joins the fray, and together they make a stand against Emma, who easily tosses them around with her new powers. She cannot understand why the students would want to protect a mutant-hunting robot. She is most surprised by X-23 who attacks Emma to defend her friend. Laura is a mutant and Emma believed that she would side with her. Emma was able to thwart Laura's attack by shifting into diamond form. Emma offered to simply wipe the processing unit of the sentinel, so that its prime directive to \"Destroy all mutants!\" would be erased. Juston wouldn't allow this claiming that it would do away with the sentinel's personality. Having been unable to reach a compromise, Emma decided to simply destroy the machine. Rather than melting it however, she took it apart, so that Juston could rebuild it with a new unit. She melted its core so that it could not be used again. After extending an invitation to X-23 (that was hastily rejected), Emma took her leave of the school. Unbeknownst to her, Quicksilver had switched out the sentinel's unit with his super speed so that the sentinel would be safe after all. Emma's battle at Avengers Academy led to Hank Pym's announcement that the school would be closed because it was unsafe.</p><p>Later, Emma and Namor talk about <a href=\"/transonic/4005-72484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72484\">Transonic</a> being imprisoned. Namor is disgusted with it and Emma tells him she knows where the girl is. In what appears to be a manipulative moment for Emma, most likely due to the corruption and the power of the part of the Phoenix Force in her, kisses Namor and tells him Transonic is in Wakanda and that she, Emma, hasn't told Scott about her whereabouts.Another scuffle with the Avengers occurs when the Avengers invade a remodeled Utopia (which now ascends all the way into the sky with all new levels of paradise) to snatch away Hope Summers. Emma and Scott prepare to battle the Avengers and permanently end the conflict, but the Scarlet Witch intervenes and teleports a voluntary Hope and the Avengers away. Emma talks with Cyclops who goes on to say that despite all the good X-Men do and all the good they have done, mankind still hates and fears them. That they will always be pushed further into a corner and steal away their innocent despite being endangered so few. The humans will always send their \"heroes\" to attack the mutants and continue to push them around. She watches as Cyclops simply states \"No more Avengers.\" He plans to take the Avengers off the board, permanently.</p><p>With Magneto bringing Namor's actions to Scott's attention, he questions Emma. Emma tells him Namor is his own man and that Scott has no authority over him. Emma tells him to look at the benefit of what happened with the Avengers being found. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five go to Wakanda where in Namor's defeat, they absorb his share of the Phoenix Force. Emma calls for a meeting with Scott in the remote location of the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia. Emma and him talk and she goes on to say she has reached into every mind on Earth. Scott tells her that she needs to stop sounding like Namor and that this isn't a war and she needs to come home. Emma tells Scott that Hope is in <a href=\"/kun-lun/4020-56104/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56104\">K'un Lun.</a> Scott rushes off to retrieve Hope leaving Emma in mid-sentence begging for him to stop her as she is scared for what she might do next as the Phoenix Force's influence corrupts her further. She ends up making a man who had a hit and run accident with a thirteen year old mutant boy years ago and never reported it just because he was a mutant, brain dead. When Colossus and Magik fight, they manage to knock each other out in an attempt to gain the other's portion of the Phoenix Force. They are returned to their normal forms as their portions of the Phoenix Force leave them and presumably go to Emma and Scott.</p><p>Emma is now almost completely corrupted by the Phoenix Force. She has forced all the remaining X-Men to bow down and worship her. Only one resisted and that was Magneto. Emma explains that she is indeed the more powerful of the two which spites Magneto to contact Xavier saying both Emma and Scott are completely gone. Scott is in need of more power after his defeat at the hands of Hope taking the power of Iron Fist and Scarlet witch so he is heading after Emma.</p><p>Emma talks with Scott telling him she can read his thoughts about how he thinks he might take her half. Emma begins to go on on a rant threatening to burn the world but Cyclops yells at her to stop talking like that and asks what has gotten into her. She replies with a worried look that she doesn't know. The Avengers and X-Men attack the two remaining avatars and they fight back. As the fight continues on the outside, Emma and Cyclops have a psychic dinner discussing things. Emma reveals to Scott even more disturbing tendencies such as using human blood as a sauce for a steak. She tells him about the psychic affair and that she truly loves him. She continues to talk about destroying the world and that she will be a queen of ash and they will just rebuild anew. Emma's corruption is almost complete and Cyclops realizes this. He asks for her forgiveness as Emma is stricken down by him and her half of the force is absorbed. Emma is arrested by the Avengers whom are then attacked by Purifers being labeled as mutant sympathizers. The Avengers defeat them and then Emma is escorted to prison and the Extinction team is revealed to still be active.</p><h3>Consequences</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2665586\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.51340996168582\" data-width=\"783\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 783px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2665586\"><img alt=\"Never without heels\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg 783w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Never without heels\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg 783w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/8/85507/2665586-poly.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Never without heels</figcaption></figure><p>Kitty sees Emma in prison, asking her if she wants Emma to take a message to Scott.

Emma is furious at Scott for all his actions and betrayal and Cyclops tells her it wasn't him and it was the Phoenix. Emma storms off and Cyclops tells her to read his mind to show her how sorry he really is but Emma reveals she cannot as the Phoenix altered their powers and her telepathy is gone. Emma also tells Scott they best not be near each other and when she was seemingly going to end the relationship right then and there, the cops start heading towards them as Magik teleports the group away. In Australia, a new mutant girl named <a href=\"/eva/4005-86432/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86432\">Eva</a> has just awakened her powers after her over protective brother started a fight. The girl formed a time sphere around a block in Australia with the Police and Federal Guard outside the sphere. Emma tells the mutant girl that these are the scariest times in mutant lives. The team offers to help her learn to control her powers if she will join them. When the temporal sphere goes down, Emma shifts into her diamond form, and along with Magneto and Cyclops, she helps protect Eva and fight off the police forces.</p><p>With Cyclops and Magneto discussing the issues at hand in a field, Emma tells them both a new mutant has been revealed. When Magik teleports Cyclops and Magneto back to the <a href=\"/weapon-x/4060-5018/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5018\">Weapon X</a> facility, Cyclops storms and Emma asks what happened where Magneto tells her that the Original Five X-Men have been brought to the present. Magneto mentions young Cyclops and Jean Grey which is all Emma needed to hear as she goes to find Cyclops. She finds him on a hill where she starts to ask him what happened. While reluctant, Cyclops tells her that they were all real. Emma ponders who would have the technology and wherewithal to something like this. With Cyclops pointing out Beast would be the only one, Emma figures it makes sense since Cyclops killed Xavier that with Hank not being able to kill Scott would punish him instead. She shows up with Scott and the group to the Jean Grey institute to deliver his explanation of what happened in Avengers vs X-Men to clear the air and offer the new students to join his side of things at the new Xavier institute.</p><p> </p><p>Emma recently took Jean Grey to <a href=\"/madripoor/4020-42665/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42665\">Madripoor</a> after promising to train her in her psionic powers.

Fabio is being detained by the police at the time for his powers awakening and causing a comotion. The X-Men manage to stop the police but are soon attacked by a group of sentinels. The veteran X-Men manage to defeat the sentinels, even with their altered powers with Cyclops delivering the final blow, leveling the entire area as the group stare in amazement at his power.

She has a deep conversation with Scott about their current situation. While they agree they are separated, they show they still care about each other and will continue to work with each other for the betterment of the students. They head inside the new school and go over the current mutant situation. The team teleports to Australia to visit Eva Bell's mother, and not long after showing up, the X-Men and recruits are intercepted by an Avengers squad.</p><p>Emma and Scott stand up to the Avengers with the bold proclamation that the Avengers are the ones responsible for the death of Charles Xavier. After some statements from Cyclops and the Avengers almost assaulting the X team, Eva Bell freezes them in a temporal bubble. Cyclops makes the statement that the X-Men will protect all the mutants and humans that support them and that a warning to the people who will deny them their freedom has been issued. The X team is transported back to the New Xavier Institute where Magneto is revealed to be the mole. The team shows disgust at the reveal except for Emma, who realizes that Magneto being a double agent is an ingenious plan and even convinces Scott it can play to their advantage.

The Cuckoos psychically torture Emma to a degree about it and uncover what happened between her and Scott. Emma doesn't blame them for their actions as she does understand they are just like her. Emma and the Cuckoos then have a psychic conversation about the events happening at the school with the original X-Men coming to the future. The Cuckoos do make mention of Jean Grey and that she is still very untrained, as they have been reading her mind quite frequently. Emma tells the Cuckoos to come with her to the Xavier School where she will continue to train them. Emma and group leave for a period to return to their school and find the new mutants getting attacked by the Danger Room. It is then that Magik's powers show her broken state as she screams out in pain, briefly disappears, and reappears in a small burst of flames. Emma and the veteran X-Men leave once more for the Jean Grey school and upon their return, the Cuckoos have come to the the new Xavier Institute along with the younger version of Angel.</p><p>After Magik's powers go off again, Cyclops has a talk with her and brings her back.

Magik manages to free herself and cast everyone out while absorbing the entire dimension into herself. One of the students, Benjamin, is nearly dead, but Emma coaches Christopher through the use of his ability and save him. Scott apologizes to the team and tells them they all must train. Emma and Scott escort Fabio home, as he could not handle the pressure that comes with being an X-man. Emma tells the team not to worry as new mutants are popping up all over the world, and the team rescues and recruits a new mutant by the name of David Bond, who has the ability to control cars. Emma is seen coaching David when he is controlling a massive plane just outside of the compound. When Irma of the Stepford Cuckoos dyes her hair, Emma is seen escorting her back inside when Celeste freaks out on her.

Much to worry of Emma, but due to a timely save from Magik, he is alright. Emma goes diamond and charges the machine, only to be knocked back and caught by Angel. The rest of the X-Men try their luck at attacking it, but the sentinel keeps adapting. Eventually, Magneto arrives and does a final attack. The sentinel appears to ready to explode, and with Cyclops demanding the robot tell him who sent it, Emma saves Scott before it does leave an explosion, but only due to the assailant calling it back.</p><p>During a training session, Emma watches as Cyclops is being especially hard on Benjamin for giving up in a training exercise. When Benjamin gets out of the shower, Emma is clad in different clothes and begins to get close to the student in an attempt to make him uncomfortable and push him to get his powers to activate. The attempt works as Emma picks up on his traits and comes to the conclusion that he is more than just a shape-shifter, and that he can mess with technology, and that he releases a pheromone of sorts that makes people feel good about themselves. Emma and Magik take him to Atlanta, Georgia where they put his powers to the test. Emma ends up having the student run an actual mission. She hands him a letter and tells Benjamin to bring it all the way up to <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dum-dum-dugan/4005-3526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3526\">Timothy Dugan</a>'s office with a note telling him that in someone inside SHIELD is attacking mutants. Benjamin ends up passing and Emma tells Scott about his successful mission.</p><h3>X-Men vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.</h3><p>The team responds to a new mutant but it turns out to be a trap. Emma and everyone are attacked by a large sentinel and their powers begin to shut off. Emma manages to help get the students behind Cyclops and Magik saves the day with a spell. Emma and the group head back to the institute and come to the conclusion that whoever is baiting them is using cerebro and sending out false signals to lure them in. They unplug cerebro and they come to the conclusion that only a few people know to use cerebro: Xavier who is dead, Magneto, who wouldn't do this, and Beast. Cyclops and Magik head to the Xavier institute and leave Emma behind with the students. Emma is later seen with the students knowing that something wrong is happening and that she is worried about Scott. Emma is with the students when Magneto shows up with Dazzler. He has Triage heal her. Emma and the crew are about to leave when Magik arrives and teleports them to the Jean Grey school to see what is happening. They look on as Sentinels and helicarriers are attacking, but Hijack returns and saves the day. Scott reveals to everyone that it was Dark Beast who attacked them, but what happened was on Maria Hill's watch.</p><h3>Battle of the Atom</h3><p>Emma Frost and the rest of the Uncanny X-Men arrive on the scene of a battle to team up with Kitty Pryde and her students consisting of the remaining Original Five X-Men. After the destruction of all the sentinels, one of the heads remains active and kills the younger Cyclops, causing the older one to disappear and cease to exist. Emma gets Christopher to revive the younger Scott Summers, and the older one returns back to reality. After the battle, the Uncanny X-Men leave and return to their school where they watch the footage of their fight for studying. Emma ends up having a telepathic battle with the older Jean Grey from the future by being a conduit for the Stepford Cuckoos' telepathy, but Emma is ultimately defeated. More and more X-Men from the future continue to come to the present. Emma, along with the rest of the X-Men, continue to battle the designated evil future team. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s anti-mutant weapon armament is completely activated, and the X-Men work together to finish the battle while they manage to stop the assault, but not without some casualties.</p><h3>Original Sin</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4171586\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.88571428571429\" data-width=\"630\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 630px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4171586\"><img alt=\"Emma and Ant-Man: joining the team! \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg 630w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emma and Ant-Man: joining the team! \" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg 630w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4171586-6485970619-spin1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emma and Ant-Man: joining the team! </figcaption></figure><p>Emma Frost was recruited by a mysterious boss during the events of Original Sin to join a team of three that included Ant-Man and the Black Panther. Other teams of two or three were also being formed, and each group led a mini investigation of the death of Uatu the Watcher. Their investigations would eventually lead all the involved parties to a supposedly secret space station, in which all the teams argued with each other and tried to answer some of their questions. Who had led them there? Who were they working for? And why? Fighting broke out as an enraged Gamora threatened the Winter Soldier who appeared to have murdered Nick Fury. Emma Frost came to his defense, shifting into diamond form, and smashing her fist into Gamora, who returned the blow in kind. Eventually, things cleared up. The Nick Fury that Bucky had \"killed\" was actually a Life Model Decoy. The real Nick Fury revealed himself to the teams as the mysterious boss that they had been working for. He explained his story to them - that he was the \"man on the wall\" doing terrible things to defend Earth. He had selected each of them and led them to the space station so that he might choose one of them to become his successor. He believed they each possessed a special and lethal set of skills that would make them right for the job. The Avengers back on Earth soon caught on, and made their way to the space station to investigate. A battle between the Avengers, Fury, and Fury's possible successors ensued. When all was cleared up, and Fury was presumed dead, the heroes, including Emma returned to Earth ... except for Thor, who because of something Fury whispered to him, was unworthy of his hammer, and could no longer lift it.</p><h3>The Last Will and Testament of Charles Xavier</h3><p>Emma is seen with Dazzler, Magneto, and Magik at Mystique's old hideout in search of her. They find nothing and head back to the New Xavier School. Emma talks with Scott that he needs to apologize to David for kicking him off the team. Later on, the Jean Grey Institute Staff arrive at Scott's school and tell him that he needs to come with them about Xavier's will. Emma volunteers to go in Scott's place, but they all head to the JGS, and there She-Hulk begins reading the will and announces that Xavier was married to Mystique. Emma ends up being the only one to laugh at the new found revelation. Emma sat and listened with most of the Will as Xavier explained how he was forced to psychically and slowly, lobotomize a young mutant by the name of <a href=\"/matthew-malloy/4005-105952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-105952\">Matthew Malloy</a>, since Xavier could not help him and his powers were too strong to control. After Xavier mentions that this goes against everything he taught the X-Men that no mutant should ever be left behind, but he did to this one, only periodically reinforcing the psychic blocks he built in the child over the years. With Xavier telling them that the rest of the will is to be played after Cyclops and Wolverine, along with Rachel Grey, reinforce the mental blocks on Matthew, Cyclops has an outburst in anger. While he refuses to help Xavier due to being lied to, Emma is the only one who seems to get through to him, and thus, he leaves for Xavier's final request with Emma staying behind at the Jean Grey Institute.</p><p>Emma is with Kitty and Dazzler when Beast walks in with the rest of the JGS staff to warn them that no one is going to help them, but that SHIELD is planning on attacking and killing Malloy, whom Cyclops is with. Beast gets an update that Scott was killed during an attack on Malloy. Upon hearing this, Emma storms out of the Jean Grey School and onto the lawn, and in her grief, causes a massive psychic projection that harms the staff and students of the school along with the Cuckoos back at the New Xavier School. Matthew Malloy appears on the front lawn in front of her, and Emma asks if he was there with Scott. After he replies yes, Emma punches him, and in reflex Malloy accidentally kills her.</p><p>After Eva goes back in time to find a younger Xavier, she tells him what is going on, and they fix it by making sure Malloy's parents never conceive Matthew and Eva returns back to her timeline, which has then prevented any of the teachers from dying. The will is finished and Scott inherits the Jean Grey School, but he signs it over to Storm and asks for her to take in his students, and all Emma says is Scott just shut down the school.</p><p>After the events of the Last Will and Testament of <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier,</a> Scott has shut down his school and transferred the students to the Jean Grey Institute. Emma questions Scott about the revolution and what it truly meant. She suggests they start all over. Scott shoots her down, but Emma reveals her powers have returned and that he is conflicted about her and that she is to him as well. She wishes him good luck and she leaves the school.</p><p> </p><h3>Death of X</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078312\" data-ratio=\"0.82262996941896\" data-width=\"654\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 654px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:82.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078312\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg 654w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg 654w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078312-dox2+-+edited.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Emma reappears during the 8 month gap after Secret Wars and has returned to Cyclops' team. They are investigating a distress call they received from Muir Island. They discover the death of Multiple Man, and upon further investigation, realize there is a Terrigen Cloud around the island. Shortly afterwards, it causes Cyclops to die. Emma then uses her telepathy to make a projection of Cyclops as if he is alive and orchestrates the whole plan of Death of X. The Cuckoos help her project this image of Cyclops to everyone on the entire planet. Emma's projection of Cyclops gives a speech, warning everyone about the toxicity of the Terrigen Mist. She uses this projection to warn the world of the cloud, recruit the mutant known as Alchemist to alter the cloud and destroy one of them. She uses this projection to attack the Inhumans, and destroys half of the Terrigen Mists. The Inhuman royals intervene and the projection of Cyclops \u00a8dies\u00a8 at the hands of Black Bolt, giving Cyclops a meaningful death. Emma later reveals to Havok that Cyclops died before all of this and that she simply wanted to give his death meaning for all that he did for the world. A truce between the X-Men and the Inhumans has been negotiated, and Emma leaves, giving them time to find a solution.</p><p> </p><h3>Inhumans vs X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078317\" data-ratio=\"0.4453125\" data-width=\"896\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 896px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078317\"><img alt=\"Beating Black Bolt\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png 896w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Beating Black Bolt\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png 896w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078317-screenshot+2017-10-01+at+6.59.01+pm+-+edited.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Beating Black Bolt</figcaption></figure><p>Emma returns to the X-Men after they fail to find a solution to the problem of the toxic Terrigen mist.

As a part of her deal with Hydra, Emma keeps the mutant population docile by telepathically controlling them. She also controls Xorn, who is a mere figurehead she has propped up as the King of New Tian. Emma operates from the former X-Men base of Utopia, which has been rebuilt.

Emma telepathically toys with teenage Cyclops, until the other X-Men come to free him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078331\" data-ratio=\"0.50946502057613\" data-width=\"1215\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1215px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6078331\"><img alt=\"No mutant will kneel to Hydra.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 1215w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No mutant will kneel to Hydra.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 1215w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/6078331-secret-empire-9-marvel-spoilers-00-banner-e1503924464923.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>No mutant will kneel to Hydra.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, Captain America realizes Emma has a piece of the cube, and sends Hydra forces to invade New Tian. The invasion force has orders to bring Emma in, along with the cube fragment. Emma refuses, saying she will go and hand the fragment in herself as a sign of good will, and she will negotiate a cease-fire, not a surrender. She threatens to unleash King Xorn on the Hydra forces if they do not accept her terms. Emma marches into the capital, while the remaining heroes are fighting Hydra forces.

Her psionic powers allow her to perform several feats such as mental communication, mind reading, mind control, induce paralysis, possession, hypnosis, pain stimulation, illusion casting, astral projection, psychic surgery, and by collecting ambient psionic energy she can create powerful psionic lightning bolts or \"psi-bolts\", that can attack on a physical or mental level and are capable of rendering a person unconscious or even killing them. Emma's telepathy is powerful enough to communicate and effect people all the way across the planet. She has even done a mental broadcasting of Cyclops' own thoughts to all of the remaining mutants that were left on the Earth. Emma has also displayed psychometric powers, having taught a class of young mutants how to do so, as well. Using her telepathy, she can also psionically shut off another's mutant's telepathy.</p><p>Emma has been stated to be an \"Omega Class Telepath\" (the same classification as Charles Xavier), a level 10 psi and one of the top five telepaths on Earth. Emma's telepathy manifested itself in her teens, and she has devoted her life to mastering her many psychic skills. For a period following the death of Jean Grey and the de-powering of Professor Xavier (though he has since regained his abilities), Emma has acted as the X-Men's primary telepath.</p><p>After utilizing and losing the Phoenix Force post Avengers vs X-Men, Emma's powers have been altered with her losing most of her telepathy as result. Another side effect from the Phoenix Force altering her powers, Emma now projects her thoughts unto people at random intervals with no control over this change.</p><p>Despite the initial loss of her telepathy, for awhile Emma only had a modicum of her previous power levels. Emma is still one of the most skilled telepaths on Marvel Earth. In place of her shattered telepathy, she was relying upon on the powers of other telepaths to which she uses her own mind as a conduit for, such as the Stepford Cuckoos' or the young Jean Grey's telepathic powers. This enables her to engage within telepathic battles and make full use of her skill since the younger mutants do not possess the knowledge she does. Emma recently revealed that her broken telepathic powers have been repaired and back at her normal levels due to training with the Stepford Cuckoos.</p><p>Her power levels have increased to the point where she was able to create and sustain a projection of Cyclops for an extended period of time. She was able to project her thoughts to the entire world, with teh aid of the Cuckoos. This projection of Cyclops was even caught on camera, suggesting that Emma's illusions are not just in the mind of her targets. </p><p> </p><h4> </h4><h4><b>Organic Diamond Form</b></h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-79624\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79624\"><img alt=\"Diamond Form\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Diamond Form\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Diamond Form</figcaption></figure><p>Emma gained a secondary mutation during the destruction of <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a>, which manifested as complete transmutation of her organic tissues into a diamond-like substance. It was later revealed in a flashback that <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\">Cassandra Nova</a> possibly catalyzed Emma's secondary mutation in order to allow her to survive the harsh environment of Genosha (however, it is still questionable if this is really true). This ability allows Emma to turn into an un-living yet sentient and mobile diamond form, granting her extreme resistance to damage, invulnerability to cold and heat, enhanced speed, super strength (no limit has been clearly defined but handbooks say approximately 2 tons), immortality, and limitless stamina as her body does not tire or produce any fatigue toxins while in this form. She also does not feel pain or emotions and has no need to eat, sleep, or drink while in diamond form. A drawback of her diamond form is she can not access her telepathy, but in return it grants her telepathic immunity to all but a few telepaths. Emma can stay transformed for as long as she likes, and the speed it takes for her to transform in and out of her diamond form is almost instantaneous, being described as happening within a hundredth of a second.</p><p>Emma's diamond form has stood up to Cyclops' optic blasts, jet crashes, blasts from Bishop, hits from World War <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, the collapse of Genosha, a blast from Black Bolt, and even a blast from the <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/4005-22836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\">Dreaming Celestial</a>'s head when it was taken over by Mr. Sinister. Emma can be broken if hit with the appropriate amount of force, appropriate weapon and her shatter point (believed to be somewhere on her forehead). Her first instance of entirely shattering was due to a diamond bullet hitting her in her shatter point at extremely high speeds. In her second instance of breaking (this did not involve her shatter point), Emma's arm was cut off when attacked by one of the Dreaming Celestial's \"mini celestial\" probes its body broke into. Despite her arm breaking off, this shows an impressive upper limit to the kind of damage her diamond form can take, considering one of them was able to blast a massive hole in Colossus' chest and send him flying across San Francisco.</p><p>Emma's strength increases in diamond form, and she has served as the muscle of the team when Colossus was unavailable. In her diamond form, she has been able to break Black Bolt's voice box and jaw, and impale him on her arm, despite his high degree of invulnerability. </p><h3> </h3><h3>Former Powers</h3><h4> </h4><h4>Phoenix Force</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2418950\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.265873015873\" data-width=\"252\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 252px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2418950\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" data-width=\"252\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg 252w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/2418950-avengers_ac_33c.jpg 252w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" data-width=\"252\"></noscript></a></figure><p>While in possession of part of the Phoenix Force, Emma acquires new powers on top of her old ones. She gains the ability to manipulate the Phoenix' cosmic energy for various purposes such as <strong>setting enemies on fire</strong> or simply projecting it as <strong>energy blasts</strong>. She also gains <strong>telekinetic</strong> capabilities and the ability to <strong>fly</strong>. Her <strong>telepathy</strong> has grown in strength as she was capable of reaching into every mind on Earth. She gains a massive strength boost easily putting her in class 100+ as she was able to fight and defeat a Mjolnir wielding Thor without much difficulty using nothing but physical combat. In her diamond form she becomes almost completely invulnerable as X-23's adamantium claws could not cut her.</p><p>Perhaps Emma's most unique ability gained from the Phoenix is when Thor \"shattered\" her, (it is possible Emma feigned Thor actually shattering her considering she was playing with him the entire fight) she had conscious control over all the fragments and rained them down through him and then reformed herself, showing Emma in her diamond form combined with the Phoenix Force is possibly unkillable. Despite her now found powers, Emma is not without weakness. Special Shi'ar weaponry, the Iron Fist energy from K'un-Lun and the Scarlet Witch's chaos magic have all been shown to harm them. However, as the Avatars gained more power when one falls, the Scarlet Witch's magic has grown to be less and less effective. As she gained more and more power, the Phoenix's corrupting influence over Emma grew stronger and stronger.</p><h3><b>Abilities</b></h3><h4>Gifted Intellect</h4><p>Emma is extremely intelligent and cunning, allowing her to traverse the ranks of business, the Hellfire Club, and the X-Men, as well as acquire a great deal of wealth. Her persuasive manner and abilities can easily sway others to do anything in her favor, especially when this skill is backed up with her telepathy.</p><p>Emma has also spent a great deal of time mentoring young mutants, granting her tremendous knowledge in mutant powers and how they work. When she possessed Iceman's body, she was able to use his powers in ways he had never been capable of before. Emma was the one that discovered Cyclops' inability to control his optic blasts was actually the result of mental blocks that Scott imposed on himself at a young age (and not physical brain damage, as was previously believed) and performed 'psychic surgery' that allowed him to control his powers for a time.</p><h4>Expert Technician</h4><p>Emma Frost is highly skilled in electronic theory and electronics, and has learned how to build devices that can amplify psionic energy and utilize psionic energy for various effects. She devised the mechanism by which <a href=\"/mastermind/4005-8306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8306\">Mastermind</a> projected his illusions directly into the mind of the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a>.</p><h4>Defense Training</h4><p>Emma is a capable fighter in her own right. While in her diamond form, she was able to hold her own quite well against <a href=\"/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a> and <a href=\"/sage/4005-4559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4559\">Sage</a> until Bishop was forced to blast her away from the battlefield.

Xavier and Frost became romantically involved while Xavier was still in a relationship with Mystique, causing Mystique to angrily lash out at Xavier in a grotesque form until Emma had to diamond-punch her. Emma was even responsible for the naming of Xavier's cat, saying it should be named Mystique when it destroyed his office in a similar manner to the actual Mystique. Emma and Charles, however, didn\u2019t make it as a couple. Frost leaves Xavier for mostly ideological differences as she thinks his approach to the mutant/human relation was too violent. Frost is more passive towards working on the mutant/human relation then Xavier. Frost goes back to Chicago and becomes a teacher giving mutant education seminars.

Xavier tried to convince Emma to come back to the school but she declined and returned to Chicago. In Chicago, she creates a new program called Academy of Tomorrow (the X-Men-like squad of the school being the Ultimate version of the New Mutants). She was later shown to be dating Shinobi Shaw (son of the deceased leader of the club, Sebastian Shaw). After Shinobi is arrested for attacking Jean Grey in order to release the Phoenix Force she was revealed to be the White Queen of this universe's Hellfire Club (wearing an outfit highly similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen garb) and requesting a new boyfriend. During the <a href=\"../../ultimatum/39-55745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimatum</a> event, she is later confirmed dead by <a href=\"../../madrox/29-7910/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madrox</a> in issue #3.</p><p>This version of Emma dresses more modestly and professionally than her mainstream counterpart, with even her initial outfit similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen costume showing very little skin. It is only when she is revealed as the White Queen that she wears the more revealing attire recognizable by her alternate counterpart.

In this future, Charles Xavier is still alive, and both he and Emma work for Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. as telepathic informants. They scanned the minds of the time-displaced Wolverine and Invisible Woman to verify their accounts. Emma determined that they were telling the truth. In this future, Morgana Le Fay is a constant threat to the civilization built by the heroes. Emma and Xavier were sent by Stark to send the Defenders (the group that replaced the Avengers and picked up Sue and Logan) back to their Defender Sanctorum. The group did not want to comply, and forced their way into the Starkguard Carrier despite Emma and Xavier's attempts to stop them. Amidst this conflict, Morgana Le Fay commenced another attack, drawing the full attention of the Defenders of S.H.I.E.L.D. Emma presumably joined in the fight.

Emma is shown to be very protective of her children due to her seeing a fair share of students dying and cannot see her children suffer the same fate.</p><h3><b>Home World of Crusader X (Earth-2122)</b></h3><p>Emma was enslaved by the <a href=\"../../shadow-king/29-14889/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow King</a> and was killed when Mastermind use her to boost his powers up in an attempt to corrupt <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey.</a></p><h3><b>Earth-889</b></h3><p>Emma leads the X-Society along with Cyclops. Wolverine and Beast. The team investigates occurrences in New Albion (which is known as <a href=\"../../california/34-55716/\" rel=\"nofollow\">California</a>). Emma also refused Cyclops proposals stating her desire to avoid the \"tedious scandal\" so it would not cause any issues between the two of them. After a misunderstanding for being blamed for the deaths of the passengers in Hindenburg Disaster, the government placed the X-Society under house arrest so Emma migrated to <a href=\"../../europe/34-56099/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Europe</a> and was married to Cyclops. She later reappeared as Emmeline Frost-Summers, having married Cyclops, in the \"Exaltation\" storyline in \"Astonishing X-Men\", when Scott Summers from Earth-616 had been kidnapped by an alternate version of Charles Xavier known as \"Savior\". The world that this Xavier lived in was literally breaking apart, and only the power of Scott's optic beams were able to hold it together. However the price of this was the ultimate sacrifice: death. So Savior abducted the Scott Summers of various alternate Earths sacrificing them against their will to maintain his own world. Earth-616 Scott broke Emmeline out of her prison, and along with alternate versions of Storm, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine (known as Howlett only), they attempted to stop Savior. Reinforcements soon arrived in the form of Earth-616's Emma Frost and Ororo Munroe, who fought beside their alternate Earth counterparts. Emma helped Emmeline up and the two launched a telepathic assault against Savior. Once Savior had been stopped, Emmeline and the other aforementioned members of Scott's crew decided to remain there and band together to save that Earth. Emmeline revealed that the Scott she married - the Scott of Earth-889 - had suffered the fate Savior intended. He had died holding the world together with the energy of his optic beams. This makeshift new team would later become ... the X-Treme X-Men! Kurt Waggoner of the United States of California, General Howlett of the Dominion of Canada, and Emmeline Frost-Summers of the New Albion X-Society would soon be joined by Earth-616's Alison Blaire, aka Dazzler. They would embark on a journey to save different realities. The only way they could do this was by killing the evil Charles Xaviers in each reality. In first reality they traveled to, they stumbled immediately into the Pantheon of the Gods: Namor, god of the sea, Thor, god of thunder, Sabretooth, god of the wild, Warran, god of the air and sky, Draka, god of ice and snow, and Storm, the All-Mother. Emmeline bows to the gods so as not to incur their wrath. Alison has a problem doing so. After a brief battle with the gods, Xavier and Magnus arrive to whisk the team away to their version of Utopia. Emmeline and the head of Xavier, however, remain as telepathic servants to the gods. The X-treme X-Men return along with Magnus and Xavier only to find that the Xavier they thought was good was really manipulating the gods into killing mortals. The X-treme X-Men saved and freed the gods. In return for their favor, the All-Mother Storm offered them godhood. Emmeline decided to accept the offer, and the All-Mother began the transformation process. Emmeline notes that the one thing she had that was a weakness was her heart (emotion). The process of granting her godhood had removed that one weakness, and in the process, Emmeline's flesh turned to flawless diamond. Emmeline became the Diamond Queen, goddess of perfection and the mind.</p><h3><b>Age of Xavier (Earth-77995)</b></h3><p>Emma is a member of the Hellfire Club and is married to Iceman.

Wolverine refuses her, but is eventually forced to accept her into the team since she is the only telepath available and therefore the only one able to operate Cerebro. She successfully located Charles Xavier's lifeless body in the heart of Magneto's Genosha, but later attempts to locate Jean Grey were less successful. In an effort to remain on the team she informs Cyclops that \u201cgiven time I could locate her, but if [Wolverine] has his way I\u2019ll be gone tomorrow\u201d. Frost is intelligent and tactical, and is an extremely powerful telepath. Her first telepathic fight as an X-Man was against the Shadow King. Storm had been manipulated into believing that Africa was burning and used her mutant powers to put the fires out. However, in reality she was tearing the country apart with rain storms and tornadoes.</p><p>It was Emma's telepathic powers that saved Storm's life, the whole continent of Africa, and eventually defeat the Shadow King. Later on she was able to disable Psylocke's telepathic attacks with relative ease. Despite Wolverine's initial distrust of Frost, he has grown to accept her as a permanent member of the team.</p><p>Her battle against the Shadow King and her success to mend some of Wolverine's memories of his time in Weapon X have earned his respect. However, she is extremely secretive and on one occasion lied to Wolverine about Forge's availability. She also appears to be fond of Cyclops, often watching him from afar. Cyclops is still depressed for the loss of Jean Grey. Emma offered to delete his memories of Jean and make him normal again.</p><p>Emma betrays the X-Men after Jean is found. It is revealed that she has been working for the Inner Circle in an attempt to destroy the Phoenix Force. The Inner Circle then double crosses Emma and tries to use the Phoenix for their own ends. It, however proves too powerful for them to control. When the Phoenix Force is released and is searching for Jean, Emma traps it in her body, transforms into diamond and projects it into the atmosphere where it cannot find a host. She manages to ask Cyclops to forgive her before shattering and seemingly dies.</p><p><b>X-Men Anime (2012)</b></p><p>In the Japanese Anime of the X-Men, Emma is found to by the Astonishing X-Men (Beast, Cyclops, Logan and Storm) in a pod next to Armor in the U-Men Lab.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1985600\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.01953125\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1985600\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" data-width=\"627\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 627w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/10/101742/1985600-emma_uniformfull.png 627w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" data-width=\"627\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After copping the blame for forcing Jean Grey to commit suicide as Dark Phoenix, Emma joins the X-Men as to continue her tutelage of Armor.

She is shown to be the White Queen of the Hellfire Club lead by Sebastian Shaw. She is first shown when Moria MacTaggert sneaks into the Hellfire Club's quarters looking for Colonel Hendry. She is next seen going to meet with a Russian general who Shaw is supposed to meet. Professor Xavier and Magneto also infiltrate the building Emma is in and confront her. She is then captured and taken to the CIA headquarters. Months later, Magneto and his Brotherhood free her from her prison and ask her to join them, to which she agrees. She displays incredibly impressive telepathy defeating and blocking out Charles Xavier several times. She also possesses her diamond form which seems to augment her strength (she was able to send Erik flying into the sea with a single blow) and renders her immune to telepathy. However it does not seem to provide her any physical durability as Erik almost killed her by strangling her with the metal railing of a bed while she was in diamond form (a close up clearly shows it beginning to shatter around the area the pressure was applied, her neck) and Charles had to persuade him not to kill her, which he surely would have. In this incarnation, Emma seems to play more of a henchman-type second-in-command role rather than more of an equal power player as she was in the comics when she was the White Queen.</p><h3><b><u>Video Games</u></b></h3><h4><b>X-Men Legends</b></h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1928643\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1928643\"><img alt=\"X-Men Legends Emma\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men Legends Emma\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/75086/1928643-emma_frost1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men Legends Emma</figcaption></figure><p>Emma Frost is a playable character in X-Men Legends.

He was trained how to fight by his best friend <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, who had also lost his father, <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a>, to a viral heart disease. Not knowing this, <a href=\"/android-20/4005-40811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40811\">Dr. Gero</a> still created Androids <a href=\"/android-17/4005-40804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40804\">17</a> and <a href=\"/android-18/4005-40728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40728\">18</a>. Without a purpose the Androids turned on Gero and killed him then went on a Rampage killing hundreds.</p><p>But, Trunks often times found himself wondering, was it really worth it to fight and save people who would only live on in fear of torment and pain every day, or let them die in a quick, painless second? These thoughts made Trunks wonder all of the time. Luckily, he had a high drive to fight, as <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> had lost his father, the <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a> were blatantly useless. Even with Trunks' father, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>, they held no chance. All of them, <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>, <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Krillin</a>, <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a>, and <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tien</a>, were dead. Trunks had never gotten to meet them except as a baby, but even so he heard that they were all extremely great men from his sensei.</p><p>The Z-Fighters attempted to defeat them but without Goku, stood no chance and fell to the Androids power. It was a sad time for Earth in his time line. Everything they did was extremely covert as people had to live in fear every day of someone killing them from nowhere. Trunks and <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> spent everyday training, as they needed to be able to move out to take care of the Androids (or hold them off, to an extent) so that people could live another day .</p><p><a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, who understood him above all else. His mother, <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma Briefs</a>, was the only other person he had grown up knowing. They made Trunks' life all the more livable, even in these dark and dreary times.</p><p>\"Okay Trunks...\" <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> said. He and Trunks had been training for months on simply trying to get him into Super Saiyan level. It never worked...Trunks never had anything to provoke him to become saiyan . He had never lost anyone like <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> had, and only knew physical pain, nothing else.</p><p>\"OK...ummm\" Trunks said, only this training session was interrupted by a powerful shock wave heard from across the city.</p><p>\"Okay, let's go! Go! Go!\" <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> said, rushing his young purple haired student to the battle scene. Little did either of them know, this fight would change <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> and Trunks' life forever.</p><p>About 13 years later, the Androids were still unstopped and Trunks finally went off to fight them on his own. When he arrived on scene the Androids were already gone but Gohan was there. Trunks asked Gohan to train him so he can help him defeat the murderous Androids. Gohan agreed and started training him. But before too long they met up with the Andriods. During the battle Gohan lost his arm and gained a scar on his face. This did not stop him from wanting to stop the Androids or train Trunks.</p><p>Later, the Androids struck again. This time Gohan faught them on his own and with his condition lost to them. The Androids had killed him and Trunks showed up too late. Seeing the dead body of his closest friend, it made Trunks angry enough to transform into a Super Sayian for the first time.</p><p>3 years later, Trunks' mom, Bulma, had finished the time machine she had been working on. Trunks used this time machine to go back to the past when <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Frieza</a> was on Earth and before Goku had died. Showing up before Goku came back to Earth, Trunks easily defeated Frieza and his father, <a href=\"/king-cold/4005-45782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45782\">King Cold</a>. When Goku showed up he told him that was the son of <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma</a> from the future. He told him about how he would get sick and gave him a cure for it that was developed in the future. He also warned him about the Androids. After this Trunks returned to his own time.</p><p>Trunks later showed up to help the Z-Fighters defeat the Androids. Although when they showed up he was surprised to find that they were not the ones from his time. After defeating the Androids, Android 17, 18, and 16 were released. They easily defeated the Z-Fighters and went to find Goku. It was at this time a being called <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a> appeared. He came from another alternate future and wanted to absorb Android 17 and 18 so he could reach his perfect form. The Z-Fighters trained in the Chamber of Spirit and Time/Hyperbolic Time Chamber, so they could train for a long time but would only seem like a few hours on Earth. After this training Trunks was able to match Cell's power, even in his perfect form, although he had to change to a form that made him too slow to win.</p><p>Cell ended up defeating him but let him win so that he could warn the Z-Fighters about a tournament he was going to hold. During the tournament, Trunks was hit by one of Cell's blasts and killed but was later revived with the <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragon Balls</a>. He then returned to his time where he was powerful enough to defeat the Androids and Cell on his own.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376750\" data-ratio=\"2.3526170798898\" data-width=\"363\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 363px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:235.3%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376750\"><img alt=\"Future Trunks in Dragon Ball Super\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest 363w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" data-width=\"272\"></a><figcaption>Future Trunks in Dragon Ball Super</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dragon Ball Super</strong></p><p>Several years after killing Dabura and Babidi, and Nine years after the fall of Future Cell, a man named Goku Black goes berserk and causes humanity to be on the brink of extinction. Trunks attempts to stop Black, but fails. Bulma suggests that they should receive help from Goku and Vegeta in the past. Six months later, Bulma gathers enough fuel for a one-way trip to the past for the Time Machine, when all of a sudden, Black gets in their way. Future Trunks shields his mother when Black destroys the lab. Future Trunks is shocked to see that Black has Future Bulma. Future Bulma then tells him to go on without her, and that getting back to the past is the highest priority. Black then fires another ki blast, destroying the lab and Future Bulma as Future Trunks watches in horror. He then shakes it off and runs to find Future Mai, knowing that getting back to the past is their highest priority.</p><p>Future Trunks goes to search for Future Mai, and he is concerned at first when he knocks at her door and gets no answer, yet is relieved when he sees her. Mai asks where Bulma is, then is saddened when she realizes that Black must have killed her, and Future Trunks then confirms this by saying that in order to escape, she sacrificed herself as Black killed her, and mourns her death as he cries over his loss. Future Trunks reignites the hope of going back to the past as he shows Mai the energy that Bulma sacrificed her life to get, further stating they can go back to the past. Trunks and Mai are seen in the room. Mai asks him if he wants to rest, yet he declines. Mai offers him some meat, and as he is about to eat it, he sees a small kitten leap onto the floor, and smiles at the kitten. He asks Mai if the kitten will be alright, and she says it will, since many kittens apparently forget the face of their owner in 3 days. Trunks then offers half of the can of meat to Mai, and she at first refuses, yet realizes how hungry she is and eats it rather quickly. After she finishes eating, Trunks tells her that they only have enough energy to make a one way trip. Mai asks how they will return back to their timeline, and he responds by saying they will find a way. They then prepare to leave to Capsule Corporation, and they both see the kitten leave, and that puts a smile on their face, and they run to Capsule Corporation.</p><p>As they both are near Capsule Corporation, Mai asks if Trunks can sense Blacks energy, and he says he cannot. When they are at the door of the Capsule Corporation building, Trunks looks back and sees that Black has appeared again. He attempts to fight Black and unsheathes his sword, managing to deflect a few of his ki attacks with it, however Black easily knocks his sword away with a punch, also throwing him to the ground. Mai runs to Future Trunks, where he yells at her for not escaping when she had the chance, and Mai tells him she will act as a decoy so he can escape. He then watches as she shoots at Black with her shotgun and is thrown away like a rag doll from one of Black's ki attacks and seemingly killed. Trunks then runs to Mai to see if she is alright, and gets filled with anger as he holds her in his hands, then looks to Black, who has taken his human form, boasting how Trunks will breathe his last breathe as he looks with a smirk on his face. Enraged Trunks powers up to Super Saiyan and launches a all out assault on Black, actually catching him off guard and causing some damage to Black however Black was quick to regain the upper hand and swats Trunks away and attacks. As a Super Saiyan Trunks was able to hold his own for some time but eventually was overwhelmed and dropkicked into a wall and blasted with a barrage of Ki Blasts. While Black prepared for the kill with a Giant Golden-Black Ki Blast Trunks throws his sword at the attack, causing it to detonate in Black's face and follows up with a Masenko which Black blocks.</p><p>Future Trunks manages to escape from Black and get the time machine 17 years into the past traveling from Age 797 to Age 780, where his time machine is found by a woman and he's found inside by Present Trunks. He is then rushed onto a gurney, where Trunks gets to see him, and is shocked by Future Trunks' arrival. He is then with Bulma, Vegeta, Goku, and Trunks, where they see him and are all in concern. Trunks eventually wakes up. Upon seeing Goku, he has flashbacks showing the death of Future Bulma and Future Mai. He then mistakes Goku for Goku Black and attempts to attack Goku in anger, much to Goku's confusion. However, Goku halts Trunks' attack by grabbing his arm before the attack can hit. However Future Trunks is able to see with Bulma's help that Goku isn't his enemy and Trunks calms down and explains what happened. Goku, curious to how strong Future Trunks is, asks to have a sparring match with Future Trunks. Future Trunks accepts and powers up to Super Saiyan 2. Impressed, Goku also powers up to Super Saiyan 2 and then eventually goes farther to Super Saiyan 3. Bulma, fearing for the city, erects a barrier around them so they can fight in peace. Fully powered up, Future Trunks, as a Super Saiyan 2 attacks with his sword. The force from the blow shatters the barrier but Goku as a Super Saiyan 3 caught the blade without much effort then proceeded to overpower the young Saiyan. Goku helps Trunks to his feet and tells him that he is impressed with his power and is amazed that he was able to get so far on his own.</p><p>Future Trunks is then greeted by Krillin and Piccolo, who ask if something happened in the future. Then, a sudden thunderstorm appears, and Goku Black appears through a portal, which shocks Future Trunks. Future Trunks becomes enraged by Black's appearance in the past he is ready to fight but is stopped by Vegeta. He watches the fight between Super Saiyan 2 Goku vs Black and he wonders why Goku doesn't go all out. When the fight ends, Black is sucked back into the future, but not before Black destroys the Time Machine. With the Time Machine destroyed, Future Trunks is stranded in the past with no way back to Future Earth. He then learns about the Time Ring from Whis and Beerus and asks for one but Beerus tells him that The Time Ring can only be used by the Supreme Kai. Bulma then found a capsule and opens it revealing, the Time Machine that Cell came in from the Future. Bulma revealed that before Future Trunks went back to the future after Cell's defeat he gave that capsule to Bulma she could never figure it out so she put it away and forgot all about it. Now that she has her future self's notebook she can fix it and make it work.</p><p>Future Trunks then meets present day Mai and tells her about her future counterpart. He tells her about how her future counterpart and how she was leader of the resistance against Goku Black. Goku then interrupts the story saying that Future Trunks should rest since he's been pushing himself ever since he got to the present timeline. Future Trunks then takes a nap, but has a nightmare about Black so he wakes up and checks on the progress of the Time Machine, and Bulma says she already has the fuel for the Time Machine, much to Future Trunks' surprise. He then goes outside where Piccolo and Krillin are cleaning up the mess from the battle and asks them where Gohan is, thinking maybe he should take Gohan to the future as well. Piccolo says that's a bad idea because Gohan is not as strong as he used to be, and told Future Trunks he \"wasn't the same Gohan he knew\".</p><p>Future Trunks then visits Gohan during his conference, and they have ice cream together, while Future Trunks is somewhat shocked and slightly disappointed with Gohan's current power, and feels like he can't recognize him at all. Gohan invites him to meet his family, and they travel to Gohan's house, where Future Trunks meets Videl, Mr. Satan and Gohan's daughter, Pan. While Future Trunks waits for Gohan to finish his work, and Videl to prepare dinner, he babysits Pan, and wonders why is he there doing nothing, and Pan begins a tug-of-war with Trunks over his sword, until Gohan arrives to stop Pan. Future Trunks and Gohan then go outside with Pan, and they begin to talk about how Gohan should be stricter with Pan, but can't help himself as he gets \"soft\" whenever he looks at her. After Future Trunks sees Gohan playing with Pan, he has a vision of how his future would've been if Black hadn't shown up, and realizes the reason why he has to fight Black; in order to allow the people of his future to live happily like Gohan and his family, and is finally able to lighten up after the traumatic events he witnessed. Upon arrival back at Capsule Corp Trunks bumps into Krillin and talks for awhile and Krillin wants to introduce Trunks to his wife and kid to which Trunks is excited to mert. Upon seeing 18 Trunks prepares to draw his sword but Krillin stops him and says that 18 is his wife, much to Trunks shock and 18 reveals she even has a kid with Krillin which shocks Trunks more. After clearing things up with Trunks 18 rejoins Krillin and there daughter.</p><p>The next day Vegeta takes Trunks to the forest to train and Trunks powers up to Super Saiyan 2 and wants Vegeta to go Super Saiyan 3 like Goku. Vegeta only laughs and goes Super Saiyan Blue, which confuses Trunks initially but Trunks is quickly able to figure out what Super Saiyan Blue is and also figures out Goku can do this form as well and believes that Black can easily be stopped if Goku and Vegeta fight him together as Super Saiyan Blue's. Vegeta begins to mock Trunks and says let's make it a game and Vegeta says if Trunks can hit him once Vegeta will forfeit the match to Trunks. Trunks responds by transforming into Super Saiyan Third Grade while Super Saiyan 2 for a massive power boost which Vegeta mocks and calls a primitive transformation and charges Trunks rapidly moving around him trying to confuse him. However Trunks is able to follow his father and at the last moment power back down to Super Saiyan 2 and counter attacks and begins to actually push back Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta with Vegeta realizing Trunks lured him in with the form. Vegeta is quickly able to regain the upper hand and begins to attack, with Trunks able to hold his own for a time but is eventually kicked through the forest and into a cliff as Goku and Bulma arrive via Instant Transmission. Trunks appears to have been beaten and power back down to base form, with Vegeta lifts Trunks by his shirt and begins mocking Trunks more and telling him that his goal should be to become the strongest in the universe and not just beat Black. Bulma attempts to move in to stop Vegeta but Goku stops her and says it's not over yet. Vegeta lowers his guard thinking he has won but Trunks springs to life and reveals he isn't hurt at all and headbutts Vegeta to the ground. Trunks begins to laugh at Vegeta and proclaim his victory over him and offers to help him up but Vegeta refuses and storms off. Trunks bows to his father and vows once again to not only defeat Black but to surpass him.</p><p> </p><h2>Equipment</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376848\" data-ratio=\"1.64\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.0%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376848\"><img alt=\"Future Trunks wielding his Sword\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" data-width=\"390\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 450w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 390w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Future Trunks wielding his Sword\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 450w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" data-width=\"390\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Future Trunks wielding his Sword</figcaption></figure><p><b>Sword: </b>Trunks has a sword which he is very skilled with and without.

This is another form achieved by Trunks during his training session with Vegeta in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. In this form Trunks' muscles become abnormally large and swell even more than in his Super Saiyan 2nd Grade form, he becomes bigger in size due to immense muscle mass increase, his hair become slightly longer and spikier from his previous form and his aura becomes spikier. In this form Trunks is at his most powerful and physically strongest however this form has great lack of speed and mobility giving Trunks a great disadvantage in battle as this form requires too much time in ki and energy consumption and cannot maintain this form for long periods due to that fact. In this form he was vastly physically stronger than Perfect Cell but lost because of extreme lack of speed. Trunks doesn't have this form as a kid.</p><h3>Super Saiyan 2:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376795\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376795\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 1920w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 1920w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>While Future Trunks is first seen with this transformation in video-games, it is confirmed in Dragon Ball Super anime that he is able to transform into it. Future Trunks uses this transformation for a brief moment during his spar with Goku after arriving in the present timeline, although it is not known when he achieved it. In video-games, Future Trunks' hair is spikier and straighter up, however in the anime, his hair retains the same overall style though slightly spikier and losing the thin bangs of hair close to his forehead, though this could be an animation mistake and may be fixed in the DVD Release of Dragon Ball Super.</p><h3>Super Saiyan 2 Third Grade:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376810\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376810\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>This form, identical to Ultra Super Saiyan though as a Super Saiyan 2, makes a brief appearance in Dragon Ball Super, used by Future Trunks in his sparring match with Vegeta. Vegeta gets disappointed to see Future Trunks still relying on the form, calling it primitive, but is surprised and realizes that Future Trunks only pretended to use the form in order to trick Vegeta to attack and catch him off-guard, re-assuming his Super Saiyan 2 form afterwards.</p><h3>Super Saiyan Anger (Super Saiyan Rage):</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6080692-download.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6080692\" data-ratio=\"0.56\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6080692-download.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6080692\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6080692-download.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6080692-download.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6080692-download.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6080692-download.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Is an extremely powerful form attained by Trunks when he is incredibly angry.

After his defeat, Raditz announced two even stronger Saiyans would be coming to earth, later revealed to be <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a>. <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>, taking great interest in Gohan and his power, decided to train him for the upcoming fight against the Saiyans.</p><p>A year later, when the Saiyans finally arrive, Gohan joins Piccolo, <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tenshinhan</a>, <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a>, <a href=\"/chao-zu/4005-19773/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\">Chaozu</a>, and <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Kuririn</a> in the fight against the Saiyans. Gohan fought well against Nappa, and was so overcome with rage and sadness when Piccolo was killed by Nappa, he became a worthy opponent, to the point where Nappa began to enjoy the fight. He was quickly worn-out, however, and was about to be killed by Nappa before Goku arrived. After defeating Nappa, Goku warned Gohan and Kuririn to leave, as they would only be burdens in the fight against Nappa. They leave, but Gohan quickly rushes back as he began to worry for his father. Going back, he finds his father nearly defeated and begins to try to defeat Vegeta, who is in his ape form. <a href=\"/yajirobe/4005-45990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45990\">Yajirobe</a> cuts off Vegeta's tail, reverting him back to his normal state. After more attempts to defeat Vegeta, including the Genki-Dama, Earth's fighters are exhausted and cannot continue the fight. Remembering that Gohan is half-saiyan though, tells Gohan to look up at the artificial moon Vegeta created. Gohan transforms into a great ape, greatly scaring Vegeta. Vegeta manages to cut Gohan's tail off, but Vegeta is crushed by Gohan falling mid-transformation. Vegeta then escapes into his space-pod, and leaves Earth.</p><h2>Namek/Freeza Saga</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-463935\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2222222222222\" data-width=\"225\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 225px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-463935\"><img alt=\"Kid Gohan\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/463935-307567_101526_gohan_super.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\"></a><figcaption>Kid Gohan</figcaption></figure><p>Gohan, Kuririn, and <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma</a> traveled to Namek in search of the Dragon Balls, so that they may revive their fallen friends killed in the battle against the Saiyans. But soon after arriving, they were attacked by two soldiers who destroyed their ship. Later, they ran into a Namekian village, where they caught <a href=\"/frieza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>, <a href=\"/dodoria/4005-58122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58122\">Dodoria</a>, and <a href=\"/zarbon/4005-44797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44797\">Zarbon</a> slaughtering a group of Namekians who would not tell Freeza where the Dragon Balls were. Gohan kicked Dodoria in the face, as Kuririn saved <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\">Dende</a>, and made a quick getaway. Gohan then runs into Vegeta, and gets his power unlocked by <a href=\"/guru/4005-82201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82201\">Guru.</a> Eventually, Gohan and Kuririn decide to team up with Vegeta to battle the deadly <a href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\">Ginyu Force</a>. Gohan and Kuririn fought and struggled against <a href=\"/guldo/4005-40732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40732\">Guldo</a>, who was killed by Vegeta. Gohan then fought and was defeated by <a href=\"/recoome/4005-40736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40736\">Recoome</a>.

Gohan was also the first to notice that <a href=\"/captain-ginyu/4005-40734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40734\">Ginyu</a> had switched bodies with his father Goku, and bravely fought against Ginyu, even though he was in his father's body.</p><p>Right after, Gohan and Kuririn summoned the Namekian Dragon and wished that Piccolo would be revived from the dead, and that he would be transported to Namek. Dende later points out, to Gohan and Kuririn's terror, that wishing him to Namek does only that, and teleports him to a random place on Namek. Gohan, Kuririn, and Vegeta fight against Freeza. Gohan witnesses the impaling of Kuririn by Freeza, and fights in anger against Freeza. he also witnessed Freeza murdering <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\">Dende</a>, contributed to Goku's Genki-Dama against Freeza, and witnessed his father's first Super Saiyan transformation. After being told to return to the ship by his father, he does and gets wished back to Earth. There he spends time with the Namekians as they take a long-stay vacation, and in an anime-only filler scene, fights Vegeta and is beaten, for the honor of his father. He also gets very emotional when Dende gets wished back to Namek. He also wonders why Goku has not returned, when it is revealed that he is alive and he survived Namek's explosion. He faced many threats, including Vegeta, the <a href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\">Ginyu Force</a> and the evil tyrant <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Frieza</a>. Once again, Gohan showed his awesome power against one of the most powerful fighters in the universe. Gohan was wished back to Earth and escaped Namek's destruction.</p><h2>Trunks Saga</h2><p>Gohan was one of the first to notice/be alerted of Freeza's presence during his return to Earth.

When the day came when <a href=\"/android-19/4005-40813/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40813\">19</a> and <a href=\"/android-20/4005-40811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40811\">20</a> did attack, Gohan witnessed his father fight 19. He and Trunks were also the first to discover <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a>'s molted shell. Eventually, Goku recovered from his heart disease, and trained with Gohan in the Room of Spirit and Time. Inside, Gohan transformed into a Super Saiyan for the first time, and learned how to remain transformed at all times. Gohan decided with his father Goku that they were not going to take their second day in the Room. Gohan spent the majority of the ten days before the Cell Games transformed as a Super Saiyan, as he was trying to lessen the strain of the transformation. He watched his father fight Cell in the opening round of the Cell Games, and Goku, knowing Gohan's destructive power when angered, decided to forfeit the match and have Gohan take his place. For a good part of the beginning of the fight, Gohan was not faring that well against Cell. After revealing to Cell what he thought his father's plan was, Cell decided to try to anger Gohan, creating <a href=\"/cell-jr/4005-52302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52302\">Cell Jr</a>.s to defeat his friends, and attacking Gohan even harder. After 16 had his body blown off by Cell, he convinced <a href=\"/hercule/4005-46397/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46397\">Mr. Satan</a> to throw his head over to Gohan to give him some words of encouragement. After 16's head was stomped on, Gohan's anger caused him to reach Super Saiyan 2.</p><p>After this, Gohan easily killed all of the Cell Jrs, and did a great deal of damage to Cell, almost killing him. Eventually, Gohan hit Cell so hard, that he threw up Android 18, reverting him back to his Imperfect form. Cell decided that the best way to handle things was to largely grow in size, and erupt in 60 seconds. Goku then decided it was best to teleport away with Cell to <a href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\">Kaio</a> <a href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\">-Sama's</a> planet, so that the Earth will not be destroyed. Gohan began to blame himself for his father's death, claiming that if he finished Cell off when he had the chance, none of this would have ever happened. Cell appeared in the middle of the battle-field, however, shocking everyone! Cell claimed that the reason he was revived was that the nucleus in his head that allowed him to regenerate was undamaged during the explosion. He killed Trunks, and revealed to Earth's fighters that he can teleport too, and that his power greatly increased since he was brought back from the brink of death. In a fit of rage, Vegeta attempted to attack Cell for the death of his son. Cell quickly batted him away, and tried to destroy him with an attack that Gohan blocked, causing him to lose the ability to move his arm. Cell decided to fire a Kamehameha to defeat Gohan. Gohan was not confident, however, and believed he was not able to fire a strong enough Kamehameha with one arm. Goku, from the afterlife, encouraged Gohan that he did have the strength to defeat Cell. Gohan fired his Kamehameha, and with Vegeta's help, defeated Cell. After Cell's defeat, Gohan and the others went up to <a href=\"/kami/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\">Kami's</a> lookout to wish everyone back to life.

Even though he hadn't trained in a while, he and all the other <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z Fighters</a> joined the <a href=\"/world-martial-arts-tournament/4015-56066/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56066\">World Tournament</a>.

He reluctantly agrees, does it, and then transforms into a Super Saiyan 2, mainly for the intent of showing off. <a href=\"/spopovich/4005-56782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56782\">Spopovich</a> and <a href=\"/yamu/4005-57572/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57572\">Yamu</a> then attack Gohan to try to absorb his energy for the awakening of Majin Buu. The Supreme Kai requests that Goku and Piccolo not interfere, and he restrains Gohan's energy, making him vulnerable to their attack. He is healed by Kibito, where Supreme Kai leads him, Kibito, Goku, Piccolo, and Kuririn to Babidi's spaceship. Gohan was with his father and Vegeta when they faced his minions. But Babidi used his magic to control Vegeta and this gave Babidi enough energy to resurrect <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Majin Buu</a>. When Gohan fought Majin Buu he was easily defeated by the seemingly invincible enemy.</p><p>Supreme Kai saved Gohan and took him back to his world. Gohan was able to do something no Kai had ever done, pull the Z Sword from it's stone prison. He trained with the sword but when it was put to the test, it broke. Out of the sword emerged the <a href=\"/elder-kai/4005-65018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65018\">Old Supreme Kai</a>, who was able to perform a ritual that unlocked Gohan's hidden powers, making him a powerful warrior.

Thanks to his Saiyan lineage, and the training his has received, Gohan possesses vast superhuman strength, speed agility, reflexes, Ki manipulation, durability, can go Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2. He is stronger than Goku was in his SuperSaiyan 1 form, putting his strength over Class 1000 (able to lift/press more than 1000 tons). He can move, fight and fly at several times the speed of sound, and can increase all of his capabilities hen transforming into his SuperSaiyan 2 and Mystic Saiyan forms. His main attacks are the Kamehameha and the Masenko. He has been trained by his father (Goku) and Piccolo, two of the greatest fighters on Earth. Gohan has also trained in The Hyperbolic Time Chamber.</p><p>His transformation into a Super Saiyan increases his power exponentially. Toward the end of the series after training with the Old Kai, he gains the ability to transform into what is known as Mystic Gohan, also known as Ultimate Gohan, which gives him greater power than his previous Super Saiyan forms. But he can still transform multiplying his mystic power.</p><h3>Transformations</h3><h4>Oozaru (Great Ape)</h4><p>Gohan like all Saiyans can transform into a giant ape by absorbing light reflected by the Moon (Moonlight) and channeling the light through his body into his tail which triggers a natural reaction that transforms Gohan into a giant ape with blood red eyes, brown fur and a large tail. While in his Great Ape form Gohan retains to no aspect of his personality and is extremely violent, save, brutish, mindless and virtually uncontrollable and he loses a great deal of intelligence while in this transformation. In addition this transformation multiplies Gohan's base power by 10. If Gohan's tail is cut off while he is in this form he will revert back into his base Saiyan form and if his tail is cut off before he transforms he will be unable to transform into a Great Ape unless his tail regrows.</p><h4>Super Saiyan</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4864170\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4864170\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864170-teen_gohan_%28super_saiyan%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Gohan, like nearly all of the Saiyans on Earth, is able to transform into a Super Saiyan multiplying his power by 50 his base power.

Gohan's immune system is greatly reduced and he becomes a lot more vulnerable to diseases and this vulnerability is increased in each form after the Super Saiyan.</p><h4>Full Powered Super Saiyan</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4873596\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4873596\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.png 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4873596-gokuandgohanhtcnv.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Gohan through intense training with Goku in The Hyperbolic Time Chamber is able to reach the physical and mental perfection of the Super Saiyan form dubbed Full Powered Super Saiyan. In the Full Powered Super Saiyan form his power and speed surpasses that of the Androids and is nearly equal to Perfect Cell's power. Gohan as a Full Powered Super Saiyan is stronger than Goku as a Full Powered Super Saiyan. This was stated by both Goku and Gohan when Goku said \"When Cell and I were fighting did you think it was hard to keep up were we ever moving to fast for you to see\". Gohan said \"no I could see it all but that's only because you and Cell weren't fighting with your full power if you were moving as fast as you could\" Goku then says \"I don't know about Cell but I gave it my all, you thought i was holding back because you compared the energy you sensed from me to your own\". Piccolo then asks Gohan if that's true Gohan responds yes.</p><h4>Super Saiyan 2</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3364949\" data-ratio=\"1.3636363636364\" data-width=\"1540\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1540px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3364949\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png 1540w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png 1408w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png 1540w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png 1408w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80111/3364949-gohan+ssj2.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Gohan was the first Saiyan on Earth to ever reach the Super Saiyan 2 or ascended Saiyan form. In this form his power is multiplied by 100. He first displayed this when he was training with Goku in The Hyperbolic Time Chamber and was knocked down. Due to emotional stress, he momentarily transformed into a Super Saiyan 2 until falling unconscious because of excess wounds during training. He later transformed fully into a Super Saiyan 2 during his battle with Cell when Cell stepped on Android 16's head while 16 was talking to Gohan whom he considered a friend. After he witnessed his friend be destroyed the emontianal stress triggered the transformation into Super Saiyan 2. In this form Gohan is stronger than Perfect Cell at full power. Gohan's last transformation into the Super Saiyan 2 was during the Majin Buu Saga when he was fighting in a World Tournament. After that day, he was never seen to transform into a Super Saiyan 2 however he did transform into a Super Saiyan 2 prior to the World Tournament in order to fight Broly. But as an adult gohan was weaker than when he fought Cell as a Super Saiyan 2 due to his lack of training. But after training with the Z sword as a adult his power greatly increased Supreme Kai thought he could beat Majin Buu. When they tested the Z sword Gohan without transforming had the power to break it. Gohan is stronger than when he fought Cell after training with the Z sword. After training with the Z sword it is belived that Gohan is as strong as Super Saiyan 2 Goku and Majin Vegeta. Gohan could only access his true power when angered if he were angered like when fighting Cell Goku said Gohan could beat anyone. Like in all Super Saiyans forms, Gohan's physical attributes are increased dramatically and his power exceeds the previous Super Saiyan form greatly. The appearance of a Super Saiyan 2 are larger muscles to the previous form, the user's hair stands straighter with fewer bangs of hair hanging over the forehead and the hair increases slightly in length and has a more golden color, blue electrical arcs occasionally appear (and are more prominent when the user powers up), and he has a bigger golden aura. Gohan's personality also changes from his previous forms since his face remains stern. The user's personality is more arrogant and confident. Also, the user is more likely to ignore advice from others and has a tendency to display their superior power by showing off. Gohan has displayed a hidden power since childhood and the hidden power is responsible for Gohan's ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 2 however, it is unknown if Gohan masters this form. Goku has said (talking in his head) I am proud of you son you mastered your power now use it but it's unknown what he meant whether he mastered or just has the power. Gohan has hidden powers and the reason for his hidden power is that he is a hybrid Saiyan/Human which was theorized to be more powerful than pure blooded Saiyans. But Gohan's true power as a Super Saiyan 1 and 2 could only be used through anger until he got his mystic form.</p><h4>Mystic or Ultimate Gohan</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4862305\" data-ratio=\"0.5595703125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4862305\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4862305-3071249-2933239-mystic_gohan_powers_up__dbkai_by_2d75-d39y1xe.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Mystic or Ultimate Gohan is not a transformation such as the Super Saiyan or Super Saiyan 2. It is Gohan's full power and potential unlocked in his base form. This is revealed when Elder Kai performs a ceremony to unlock Gohan's latent abilities. When in the Mystic state, Gohan is unable to transform into a Super Saiyan nor Super Saiyan 2 as his full power is already unlocked and he is in his normal form and possesses overall power far greater than the Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2. But it is shown in Battle Of Gods that Gohan can go Super Saiyan multiplying his Mystic (Ultimate) Gohan power. His appearance is slightly different to his normal form though he does not gain golden hair, blue eyes or golden auras, his hair is slightly longer, stands straighter with fewer bangs of hair hanging over the forehead and the hair seems sharper, his muscles become slightly bulkier and increase slightly, he has a white flame-like aura sometimes with lightning and his personality is changed. His personality is much more confident and arrogant in contrast to the Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2 forms and the user often grins when displaying or showing off his power and is most likely to show off or display his superior power to his opponent and might brag about his power during a battle. It has been claimed that in this form, Gohan is not only stronger than a Super Saiyan 3 but that he is also the strongest non-fused fighter in the Dragon Ball Z series. Gohan is more powerful than Gotenks. Gohan can go super saiyan in the movie Battle Of Gods. Frieza also stated that Gohan could destroy his army but instead uses non lethal attacks. Gohan's power is said to be on par with Super Buu (Gotenks and Piccolo absorbed) but was outclassed due to the unique skills of Super Buu (Gotenks and Piccolo absorbed).</p><h3>Techniques</h3><p>Leave My Daddy Alone! - This is a move that Gohan used when he was angered at Raditz hurting his father. He powers up a yellow fiery aura and dashes towards his opponent and rams them with his head.</p><p>Masenko - Is a move that he learned from Piccolo where he lifts both of his hands up, creates a yellow blast made of energy, and fires it at his opponent.</p><p>Father-Son Kamehameha - Gohan uses his energy to power up a incredibly powerful Kamehameha and launches it at his opponent with the help of his father. Gohan used this attack to destroy Cell after Goku aided him and Vegeta's distraction.</p><p>Super Kamehameha - Gohan is able to use a more powerful version of the Kamehameha.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Gohan appears in most DBZ movies and almost all video games.</p><h3>Movie Appearances</h3><p>Gohan appears in most DB movies and he is given a big role in Bojack Unbound and Broly:Second Coming.</p><h3>Video Game Appearances</h3><p>Gohan appears in almost all video games since he is one of the main characters.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

There, he meets his youngest son, <a href=\"/goten/4005-40745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40745\">Goten</a>, and becomes embroiled in defeating the evil wizard <a href=\"/babidi/4005-51121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51121\">Babidi</a>, who orchestrates the theft of Gohan's Super Saiyan energy. They attack Babidi's ship, and Babidi possesses Vegeta, then sets Vegeta and Goku to fighting one another. The pair fight for some time before Goku attempts to halt the fight so that they can team up to defeat Babidi's monster, <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Majin Buu</a>. He is knocked unconscious by Vegeta, who then abandons him. He seeks healing from Dende and teleports all his friends to himself, teaching Trunks and Goten how to perform the Fusion Dance, which will combine them into a far more powerful being. Goku then fights Majin Buu, using his powerful Super Saiyan 3 form. He easily holds his own against the monster, but does not defeat it. The strain of maintaining the form forces him to return to the Other World. There, he observes the fight between Majin Buu and the newly-created <a href=\"/gotenks/4005-51122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51122\">Gotenks</a> via a crystal globe. Gotenks performs well, but is ultimately unable to defeat the monster and is absorbed into it, as is Gohan. Goku is returned to Earth by the sacrifice of a friend. He and Vegeta fuse to become <a href=\"/vegito/4005-45788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45788\">Vegito</a>, easily defeating the monster. Vegito allows itself to be absorbed into the monster to rescue its friends and family. After a brief battle, it succeeds and Vegeta and Goku return to their normal bodies. Majin Buu is forced to transform back into its original form, Kid Buu. Kid Buu destroys the planet, briefly killing most inhabitants, though they are soon restored. Goku fights Kid Buu, and gathers energy from most sentient beings around him (using the Genki Dama Technique) to destroy Kid Buu.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p><strong>Senzu Bean: </strong>Senzu Beans are grown in Korin Tower. When eaten you are healed of all injury's and can keep a person full for up to 10 days. However if you eat to many it can be dangerous. The effects are immediate. Yajirobe has said that Senzu Beans taste like fish. Senzu Beans can heal fatal wounds such as Yamcha's impaled torso.</p><p><strong>Training Gi: </strong>Goku trains with weighted clothes sometimes, and fights wearing a Training Gi. Many of Goku's training suits are normaly Martial Arts Gi that are orange (sometimes Battle Suits like Vegeta's suits). All these clothes are incredibly durable and light (except for the weighted clothes).</p><p><strong>Flying Nimbus: </strong>Goku has a flying cloud named Nimbus that only the pure of heart can ride it was given to him by Master Roshi when Goku was a little kid.</p><p><strong>Power Pole: </strong>Goku has a magic pole that can expand to any length and it can retract Goku uses this a lot through out the Dragon Ball series.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As a Saiyan, Goku possesses all the powers inherent to his race. He is super-humanly strong and durable, and possesses enhanced speed and reflexes. He can undergo Saiyan transformations that multiply his power greatly, the first by 50, second by 100, and the third transformation Goku's power is increased by 4x Super Saiyan 2 giving him a multiplier of 400 and the anime only transformation Super Saiyan 4 multiples his power by an unknown amount, but it is greater than Super Saiyan 3's multipier. Goku has been known to take every possible advanced Saiyan form unlike Vegeta and Gohan who only reached Super Saiyan 2. However, it is speculated that since Gotenks reached Super Saiyan 3, Goten and Trunks both acquired the form, but for now they cannot handle the strain of the form, being very young.</p><p>Goku can generate energy blasts from an inner energy called ki, notably in the form of the Kamehameha Wave. He can teleport anywhere he wants instantly via Instant Transmission. He is capable of unaided flight, and was capable of aided flight through the use of a small flying cloud called the <a href=\"/flying-nimbus-kintoun/4055-56022/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56022\">Flying Nimbus</a> only those with pure hearts can ride the cloud. He is capable of transforming into a Great Ape when he is looking at the moon and possesses his tail. However Goku lost his tail in Dragon Ball. Every time Goku revives from a serious injury or intense battle, he gets more powerful. Goku is incredibly powerful.</p><p>Goku can endure taking a planet destroying Ki blast as seen when he was battling Frieza. In DragonBall Z, we also see Trunks take a Supernova attack from Mecha Freiza as a Super Saiyan, lifting it with one hand and throwing it away, so we can assume Goku is just as capable, since he is more powerful than Trunks.</p><p>Goku is displayed as being able to lift/carry at least 160 tons without transforming, although the limit may be higher. Goku has also been seen training with 10 tons on each arm and leg, while kicking and punching at super-speed, while in his Super Saiyan form. Since he was in \"afterworld\" training with King Kai at the time, he was also under 10x earth gravity, making the effective training weights equal 100 tons on each arm and leg, 400 tons in total. Without using his chi-boosting ability, Goku can lift/press more than 200 tons with minimal effort. In his SuperSayin 1 form, he is at least capable of lifting/pressing at least 10,000 tons. At the end of Dragon Ball GT, Goku achieves the final Super Saiyan form the Super Saiyan 4 and can lift over 1,600,000 tons ,and the upper limits of his strength capacity are unknown.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5205590\" data-ratio=\"0.51652574942352\" data-width=\"1301\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1301px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.7%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5205590\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.png 1301w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.png 1301w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111281712/5205590-key+based+constructs.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Goku apart from being able to manipulate ki to create destructive ki blasts also can create ki energy based constructs. Goku is shown creating significant energy based construct while he was fighting Beerus in Dragon ball Super. Goku and Beerus later in that fight absorbed the ki from their construct and continued to clash.</p><p> </p><h2>Techniques</h2><ul><li><b>Afterimage Technique -</b> A typical distraction technique where through a short burst of speed Goku is able to leave an afterimage of his body behind. This often causes the opponent to attack leaving them open for an attack normally from behind or above. Goku as a child in the 21st World Martial Arts tournament could leave 3 images behind, but by the time of the cell games Goku can leave an innumerable number of afterimages behind.</li><li><b>Continuous Kamehameha -</b> Goku's version of the Continuous Energy Volley where Goku fires many small blasts of energy in rapid succession in order to cause great damage. The technique has the downside of leaving a large smokescreen from the explosions so if the attack fails it often gives the enemy a sneak attack.</li><li><strong>Ki Sense - </strong>Goku can sense other people's Ki. He can also tell how some one is based off there power. Goku has been shown to follow entire battles (who is winning or losing) just sensing the Ki of everyone fighting. And can tell who someone is by there Ki. Goku's Ki sense is stronger than others thanks to his Instant Transmission.</li><li><b>Crazy Fist -</b> A technique Goku came up with on the fly to counter <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Jackie Chun</a>'s Drunken Fist technique. Goku hops around like a monkey giving him an air of unpredictability and uses his tail more (this was used in the Dragonball seasons when he was still a boy).</li><li><b>Destructo Disk -</b> A technique taken from <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Krillin</a> where Goku forms a flat energy disk that can cut through most objects and enemies. Due to the lethal nature of the attack Goku only uses it when absolutely necessary, like cutting off <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>'s tail when he transformed.</li><li><b>Dragon Fist -</b> One of Goku's ultimate techniques and the only one he created himself. Goku charges his fist with a golden ki dragon that resembles Shenron and punches the opponent resulting in the dragon either devouring or impaling the opponent. This move is easily Goku's most powerful move besides the spirit bomb as he was able to blast a hole in <a href=\"/syn-shenron/4005-81731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81731\">Omega Shenron</a>'s chest who was more powerful than a Super Saiyan 4 Goku.</li><li><b>Dragonthrow -</b> Goku's trademark grapple where he grabs a leg, tail, tentacle, or other extremity and spins them around multiple times incredibly fast and hammer throws them typically into a mountain.</li><li><b>Evil Containment Wave -</b> A move designed by Master Mutaito to seal Demon King Piccolo away, the move is very taxing on the body and can lead to death if the user is not strong enough. Goku learns the technique from Master Roshi to deal with the immortal God Zamasu.</li><li><b>Flight -</b> Goku is able to manipulate his ki to self propel himself for flight. Goku can either levitate lightly or full on fly at high speed. Saiyan's also have a natural ability to fly. When returning from training with King Kai during the 2nd season of \"Dragonball Z,\" Goku was able to travel 1 Million miles (the distance of Snake Way) in one day by both leaping and flying. This puts his aerial speed at roughly 54x the speed of sound (approx 41,580 mph).</li><li><b>Fusion Dance -</b> Goku learned the technique from its creators the Metamorans while in the Other World. Goku can perform the dance with <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> in order to merge their bodies to form <a href=\"/gogeta/4005-87268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87268\">Gogeta</a>. In this form they are incredibly powerful. The techniques downside is that it only lasts for half an hour.</li><li><strong>God Kamehameha - </strong>Is Super Saiyan Blue Goku's version of the Kamehameha</li><li><b>x10 God Kamehameha - </b>Is Super Saiyan Blue Goku's God Kamehameha multiplied by 10x while using Kaioken as a power booster.</li><li><b>Hasshu-Ken -</b> A technique copied and improved from King Chappa where Goku moves his arms so fast it appears he has eight arms for combat. This was used to counter Tien's Four Witches technique.</li><li><b>Homing Energy Wave -</b> Goku can fire an energy wave that tracks and homes in on his opponent by locking onto their energy signature.</li><li><b>Instant Transmission -</b> A technique that Goku learned from the Yardrats after his battle with Frieza. Goku typically places two fingers on his forehead and senses a ki signature and the instantly teleports to that location. The technique requires concentration so Goku can be interrupted or stopped by pressing the attack but Goku has overcome this and can use it in battles. Goku is the only one who can perform this technique. Goku can use the technique in fights such as when he fought cell.</li><li><strong>Instant Transmission Kamehameha -</strong> Goku powers up a kamehameha then he uses the IT technique to teleport near the surprised opponent and blast them.</li><li><b>Janken Fist -</b> Goku's original signature technique that was taught to him by his <a href=\"/grandpa-gohan/4005-60657/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60657\">Grandpa Gohan</a>. Gokku calls out the name of the attack and delivers either a punch (rock), slap (paper), or eye poke (scissors).</li><li><b>Kiai</b> - An invisble energy wave that is often used to defeat and demoralize weaker opponents or cancel out attacks without using too much energy. Goku used this to defeat <a href=\"/chi-chi/4005-40807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40807\">Chi-Chi</a> and to cancel out <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a>'s Break Cannon.</li><li><b>Kaio-ken</b> (Pronounced\"KAI-o-ken\") <b>-</b> One of Goku's signature techniques that was taught to him by King Kai. King Kai has said that Goku is the sole student to master the attack and that even he could not do it. The technique multiples Goku's ki power by 2X or more depending on how much Goku's body can take. Goku by the time of his battle with Frieza could multiple his ki by 20 times. The technique strains Goku's body so he must use it sparingly. This technique was superseded by the Super Saiyan transformation which put out more power, but put less strain on his body. Goku can combine this with his Super Saiyan transformation to make the Super Kaio-ken.</li><li><strong>Kaioken Finish </strong>- Is a technique used by Goku of which he kicks his opponent up and appears behind them and hammers them. He then activates Kaioken and double uppercuts the falling opponent. Goku used this move on Nappa and Burter.</li><li><strong>Kaioken Attack </strong>- Goku attacks his opponent with some moves before nailing the opponent with a powerful kick to the face.</li><li><b>Kamehameha -</b> Goku's most used technique and the staple move of the Turtle School invented by <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Master Roshi</a>. Goku copied this move after watching Roshi perform it once Master Roshi said it took him 50 years to master it. Goku continued to use it for the rest of his life. The Kamehameha is a blue energy wave fired from cupped hands after pronouncing the name of the attack. Goku can perform many variations of the move like shooting it one handed, firing it from his feet, bending the kamehameha, and others. This is one of Goku most powerful attacks.</li><li><strong>Kaioken Kamehameha x20 - </strong>Goku powers a kamehameha and activates Kaioken x20 and fires it at his opponent, causing great damage due to the Kamehameha's power being multiplied by 20</li><li><b>Mimicry -</b> Goku has a knack for for mimicking ki attacks after he has seen them performed. Goku learns the Kamehameha from Master Roshi, Destructo Disk from Krillin, Hasshu-Ken, and Solar Flare from Tien this way. Goku copied the Kamehamaha after seeing Master Roshi use it once it took Roshi 50 years to learn it.</li><li><strong>Meteor Combination - </strong>Goku rushes at his opponent with fast punches and kicks before punching the opponent hard on the stomach. Goku then jumps high and fires a kamehameha at the opponent. He used this move on Piccolo during the World Tournament.</li><li><b>Solar Flare -</b> A technique copied from Tien Shinhan where Goku places his hands around his face and releases a blinding flash of light used to blind opponents for either a quick getaway or as an opening for an attack. He has used this on many opponents like Vegeta.</li><li><b>Spirit Bomb -</b> Goku's most powerful move outright where Goku gathers energy from the area around him to form a positive energy ball that is highly effective against beings of evil. Goku can expand his horizon and take energy from surrounding planets even taking a galaxy wide drain to defeat <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Kid Buu</a> and a universe drain for <a href=\"/syn-shenron/4005-81731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81731\">Omega Shenron</a>. The technique takes a very long time to complete so Goku typically needs someone like <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> or <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> to run interference.</li><li><b>Super Kaio-ken -</b> A last resort move where Goku uses the Kaio-Ken along with the Super Saiyan transformation for a very powerful combination. This move is very taxing on Goku's body as one punch was enough to cause Goku to run out of breath. Goku used this technique once against <a href=\"/pikkon/4005-87211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87211\">Pikkon</a> during the Other World Tournament. This was in a Dragon Ball Z filler episode so it's not canon.</li><li><strong>Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken</strong> <strong>- </strong>Is a technique in which Goku uses Kaioken in his Super Saiyan Blue form to gain more power. His aura gains an additional red aura so he has red and blue aura.</li><li><b>X10 Super Saiyan Blue Kaikoken - </b>Is the fully powered version of the Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken where Goku multiplies his power by 10. His appearance slightly changes as his hair becomes almost white, his skin becomes reddish and his aura becomes more dense and brownish but with the blue-red aura.</li><li><strong>Super Kamehameha - </strong>Is a more powerful version of the kamehameha. Goku puts greater energy into the kamehameha and charges it more before sending the blast towards his opponent</li><li><strong>10x Kamehameha </strong>- This is a move used by Goku in his Super Saiyan 4 form. This move is greater than the Super Kamehameha because it multiplies the power by 10 and causes massive damage. It is red in color. </li><li><b>Telekinesis -</b> Goku is able to use ki to move objects with his mind, he demonstrated this by manipulating a glass of water until Chi-Chi interrupted him. Goku also lifted a pyrimid with telekinesis.</li><li><b>Telepathy -</b> Goku is able to read minds by placing his palm on the head of the intended target like when he did this to Krillin. Goku can also broadcast his thoughts to others.</li><li><b>Tornado -</b> A move Goku came up with during his battle with Nam in the Semi-Finals of the World Martial Arts tournament. Goku spins around rapidly and moves around the ring hitting his opponent though the move will make him very dizzy.</li><li><b>Twin Kamehameha -</b> A variation of the Kamehameha where Goku charges twin energy spheres that he can launch one at a time. The first time Goku used this was to test if Frieza only used his eyes instead of sensing energy.</li></ul><h2>Transformations</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082448-great_ape_dr._slump.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6082448\" data-ratio=\"0.745\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082448-great_ape_dr._slump.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6082448\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082448-great_ape_dr._slump.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082448-great_ape_dr._slump.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082448-great_ape_dr._slump.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11132/111320022/6082448-great_ape_dr._slump.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a></figure><p><b>Great Ape</b>: Since Goku is a saiyan, he can transform into a great ape if he looks at the full moon but he will need a tail in order to transform.

Goku achieved this form on Planet Namek during his final battle against the galactic tyrant, Frieza. Frieza killed Goku's best friend, Krillin, causing Goku to fall into a fit of rage and gain the legendary degree of power Frieza has so greatly feared. While in this form, Goku's eyes are colored green, hair stands on end and becomes golden in color. He also possesses a golden flame-like aura and gains an increase in muscle size. There is sometimes gold electricity sparking off him (mostly in Video games).</p><p>In this form, Goku's stats are increased 50x than his base form , allowing Goku to overpower and eventually defeat Frieza. However,his personality is affected while in this form as his good-hearted personality is now replaced with ruthlessness, anger, and rage.

Once mastered the form can be used forever Goku has stayed as a Super Saiyan even when he was asleep. This is called a Full Power Super Saiyan. Goku can maintain this form auralessly and use it as well as his base form. Goku was evenly matched with Cell as a Full Power Super Saiyan until he forfeited the fight and Gohan took his place. Vegeta has stated that Goku won't need to power up in fights he can put all the energy it takes to transform into stamina and then only go higher if he needs to. Goku has other form's such as ascended Saiyan and ultra Saiyan or second grade and third grade. But Goku uses the Full Power Super Saiyan instead of Ascended Saiyan because Goku as a Full Power Super Saiyan is stronger than Ascended Saiyan as shown when Vegeta as an Ascended Super Saiyan could not keep up with Cell Goku was equal. Goku can also control how much energy he uses. Goku as a Full Powered Super Saiyan at half power is strong enough to blow up Korin tower and kami's lookout just from emiting energy as shown when he powered up for Korin when asking if he could beat Cell. The only down side is that Goku has trouble controlling his own power.</p><p>Goku Full Powered Super Saiyan is stronger than his regular Super Saiyan because as a regular Super Saiyan Goku lost a lot of energy. This caused Goku to not fight at his full potential due to the amount of energy he was would lose. As Full Powered Super Saiyan Goku controls how much Ki he uses.</p><p>When Goku achieved Ultra Saiyan he was as powerful as Cell but was to slow to hit him do to muscle mass increase so Goku never used the form again. Goku also fought the God Of Destruction as a Super Saiyan God then he kept the power of a god and turned back into a regular Super Saiyan (Goku's body learned from the experience making him stronger) while like this he is stronger than Super Saiyan 3. This is seen with Super Saiyan 3 Goku was taken out with 2 hits by Beerus but after absorbing the Godly power Goku held his own fighting as a Super Saiyan 1.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2953388\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2953388\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111111167/2953388-6165524928-GokuS.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Super Saiyan 2</strong>: Goku's second Super Saiyain transformation. Much like the previous transformation, Goku's hair stand and is colored gold. However the hair style in more rigid. His aura takes on more fierce flame-like appearance along with crackling blue energy sparks the lightning is seen more when the user powers up.</p><p>Goku achieved this form in otherworld where he could put unlimited energy into his transformations, it was first seen in his fight against the monster, Yakon. He used it to over load the monster. In this form, Goku's power is increased 2x times the power given by Super Saiyan, multiplying his energy 100 fold, allowing him to hold his own against Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta. While Goku is not as aggressive in this form as he is in Super Saiyan 1, his power drains more quickly. But Goku has trained to minimize the drain and use the form better. This form has no specific time limit and Goku has not been seen to run out of energy while using this form unlike his Super Saiyan 3 form. Goku just has not mastered Super Saiyan 2 like he mastered Super Saiyan 1. But Goku may have mastered this form because he has unlocked Super Saiyan 3. Goku as a Super Saiyan 2 is stronger than Teen Gohan as a Super Saiyan 2 when he fought Cell during the Cell Games. This was stated by Majin Vegeta when they fought against each other with each being a Super Saiyan 2.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4864092\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4864092\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 1920w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 1920w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11124/111247399/4864092-459938-dragon-ball-z-goku-ss3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p><strong>Super Saiyan 3</strong>: Goku's third Super Saiyan transformation. Goku gained this form when he went through vigorous training for 7 years in Other world. The appearance is much different from the other two. The rigid hair style becomes smooth and flowing, sometimes growing down passed the waist and Goku's eye brow are gone. His aura remains the same as Super Saiyan 2, only bigger and with more blue energy sparks and Goku gains a muscle mass increase making him bigger than his other forms.</p><p>Goku as a Super Saiyan 3 was strong enough to cause world wide earthquakes just from the energy he was emitting transforming. This is the strongest form in the Dragon Ball Z manga and anime. In this form, Goku's Ki energy is increased four times the strength of Super Saiyan 2, multiplying his power 400x its normal power. This form was enough to stand against Majin Buu in his first and kid form. However much like Super Saiyan 2, his power drops rapidly, allowing to stay in the form only 30 minutes much like a fusion. Goku is the only the Saiyan to achieve all the levels of Super Saiyan up to Super Saiyan 3 other than Gotenks (a fusion of Goku's second son Goten and Vegeta's son Trunks) who has also achieved Super Saiyan 3.

As well as kill Frieza while in his golden form. Goku is also stronger than Beerus at 70% power. Goku's hair and eyes are blue with a fiery blue aura that sparks with lightning. In this form Goku is stronger than a regular Super Saiyan God. This form has no time limit. Goku has mastered this form in the same way he mastered the Full Powered Super Saiyan form. The Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z creator Akira Toriyama has said that on a scale in terms of power Super Saiyan God is a 6 God of Destruction Beerus is a 10 and Whis is a 15 and that Golden Frieza is not on the scale.

Son Goten is the second son of Son Goku and Chi Chi and is Son Gohan's little brother. He is also uncle to Pan. He became a Super Saiyan at the young age of 7, making him the youngest Super Saiyan ever.",
  "description": "<h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2><p>Goten is the son of <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a> and <a href=\"/chi-chi/4005-40807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40807\">Chi Chi</a> and the little brother of <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>. His best friend is 8-year-old <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks</a>. He is introduced to us during the Buu Saga at age 7. He is, like his brother, overprotected by his mother. But unlike Gohan, Chi-Chi has taken the liberty of training him since Goku has been killed by Cell. Gohan offers to take Goten to train for the upcoming tournament and is surprised to find that Goten can already transform into a Super Saiyan. Because Gohan has been slacking in his training, Goten is almost stronger than his brother at this point in time.</p><p>At the tournament, Goten meets his father Goku for the first time. He is wary of him, but grows to really like him in no time. The child's division of the tournament proves to be no real problem for Trunks and Goten until the final match where they fight one another. Before going out, they make a deal not to transform during the fight. The battle starts out and they are equally matched. Goten, forgetting the deal, transforms. Trunks reminds him and returns to normal. The fight continues and Trunks eventually knocks Goten out of the arena, transforming himself. Trunks promises to give Goten three of his toys to make up for winning.</p><p>They then dress up as The Masked Fighter to compete in the adult tournament. They make it to Android 18, but then are disqualified because 18 destroyed their costume.</p><p>Goten and Trunks go off to help Vegeta fight Majin Buu. The boys were knocked out by Vegeta before he sacrificed himself to destroy Buu.</p><p>At Kami's Lookout, Goten is informed that Gohan has ben killed by Buu. Goten, upset, begins to cry and is angry at Goku for not saving his brother. Gou explains that there is no time for crying and they need focus their anger and pain into the Fusion Technique, which will merge their powers into one being for a certain amount of time. After showing the boys Super Saiyan 3, Goku leaves for the Afterlife and leaves Piccolo in charge of their training.</p><p>Buu eventually finds them and the boys run into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, speeding up time and allowing them to perfect the technique. Buu, ready to fight them, charges into the chamber. He finds Gotenks, the fused warrior. They fight, and Gotenks pretends to lose. Piccolo, afraid, blows up the door to the outside world. Buu then creates a door out. Gotenks, upset with Piccolo for ruining everything, transforms to Super Saiyan 3 and creates a door as well.</p><p>After a quick fight, Trunks and Goten separate and are absorbed by Buu, improving his strength. They are saved by Goku and Vegeta, but are killed soon after by Earth's destruction. They are revived by the Dragon Balls after Buu is killed.</p><h2>Dragon Ball GT</h2><p>Goten is a minor character in GT. He is the uncle of Pan, and is shown with a girlfriend, Valese. He lends a hand in fighting major enemies, but does not defeat any of them.</p><h2>Transformations</h2><h3>Super Saiyan:</h3><p>Goten is the youngest Super Saiyan ever in all of Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT. As the youngest to achieve the Super Saiyan form he has perfect control and mastery over it and can use it as though it was his normal base form. Goten possibly achieved this form during a training session with Chi-Chi when she kicked which probably angered him slightly as he then transformed much to Chi-Chi's shock and knocked her down with his own attack and she then never told him to transform into a Super Saiyan again calling it a \"monster\" making Goten think that transforming into a Super Saiyan made him a monster or that when he is a Super Saiyan he is a monster, however, Gohan later explains what Chi-Chi meant and that a Super Saiyan is not a monster. However it is unknown if Goten was restraining himself during his training session with Chi-Chi and that he transformed because he realized his mother was not to be taken lightly or was not a push over and it was not the first time he achieved the Super Saiyan and was simply the first time it was seen or it was possibly genuinely the first time he had ever transformed into a Super Saiyan however it could be that it was simply the first time it was every seen rather than the first time he achieved the form.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4877710-gotensupersaiyaninv.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4877710\" data-ratio=\"1.3244444444444\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4877710-gotensupersaiyaninv.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4877710\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4877710-gotensupersaiyaninv.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111247399/4877710-gotensupersaiyaninv.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></a></figure><p>In this form Goten's base power increases 50x his original power level and it is stated that in this form he is much more powerful than Frieza using 100% of his power and he is also more powerful than the Super Saiyan Goku that fought Frieza on Namek, his power and speed increase greatly in this form and even Gohan is surprised at Goten's power when he first witnessed Goten transform, also Goku was shocked after he witnessed both Trunks and Goten transform into Super Saiyans as he stated that they should be careful or they could be surpassed by the young Super Saiyans hinting that they are very powerful or it could have simply been a joke and a surprising reaction by Goku. As a Super Saiyan Goten is stronger than android 18 as shown in the movie Bio Broly when 18 can't hurt Broly but Goten can.</p><p>In this form, Goten's appearance changes drastically as he gains a slight increase in muscle, his hair turns blonde, becomes straighter and spikier, his hair becomes longer and stands upwards on end and there are less bangs of hair hanging over his forehead, his irises turn green, his skin tone becomes lighter and a flame-like golden energy is formed around his body. Goten has perfect control over his Super Saiyan form and can easily maintain its aura effortlessly. </p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p><strong>Superhuman Strength:</strong> Goten being a Saiyan/Human hybrid is physically stronger than the average untrained Saiyan and was able to achieve the Super Saiyan form without any effort at a very young age and is functionally the youngest Super Saiyan and the youngest to ever achieve the Super Saiyan form. Goten's physical superhuman strength is far greater than any human in the universe and greater than that of an average Saiyan as he has shown to be strong enough to knock a large dinosaur unconsciousness with a single punch whilst in his normal base form without any effort and extreme ease, he easily lifted a possibly 2 ton dinosaur with no physical effort with a single arm as a child in his base form and has even surprised Gohan during their training session. It has been stated several times that Goten is more powerful than Frieza and was more powerful than Super Saiyan Goku during his fight against Frieza's 100% power state. It is unknown how many tons Goten can lift but it is highly likely that in his Super Saiyan form he can lift well over 40 tons because Goku has been seen training with 40 tons in total (10 tons on each arm and leg) in 10 times gravity making it 400 tons with no known upper limit.</p><p><b>Superhuman Speed:</b> Goten's Saiyan/Human hybrid physiology grants him vast amounts of superhuman speed. Goten reacts and moves at superhuman speed. He has shown the ability to run faster than moving cars with minimum or no effort and can functionally fly at or possibly beyond the speed of sound (770 mph). Goten has been shown dodging lightning fast attacks that cannot be seen by the human eye and he can move so fast that he can seemingly disappear and reappear in another location.</p><p><b>Superhuman Durability:</b> Goten's Saiyan/Human hybrid physiology grants him super human durability however the exact level of which is unknown. Goten has survived being knocked through very hard rock formations, he has withstood powerful energy blasts and held his own for a while against Super Saiyan Broly (not Legendary Super Saiyan Broly) and Bio Broly. Goten has withstood hits from Super Saiyan Gohan without any visible physical damage and can withstand falls from great heights.</p><p><b>Energy Manipulation:</b> Goten like all Saiyans can manipulate energy however he mostly or almost manipulates ki for various purposes such as energy blasts, energy balls, energy waves etc. Goten can manipulate ki energy to create a powerful energy blast or energy wave called \"The Kamehameha Wave\" which he mispronounces \"Kamekameha\" due to the slip of the tongue which he first demonstrated during the World Tournament during his battle with Trunks. Goten can create energy balls as well and has shown the ability to create an explosive energy ball similar to The Spirit Bomb however he does not ask for energy and uses his own, this ability is only used once and creates immense destruction upon its devastating impact. Goten can also unleash an explosive wave of energy which can be used to knock opponents away or down. Goten can gather the ki energy in his environment to increase and or enhance and or augment his power and as he increases his power a flame-like aura is formed around his body and begins to flicker as the energy shifts when he increases it. Goten can also concentrate the energy into separate places of his body such as his fists to cause more damage when he delivers punches this attack is called an \"Energy-Enhanced Strike\", Goten can also channel ki energy through his body to increase or augment his physical strength.</p><p><b>Radar Sense:</b> Goten has the ability to sense the ki energy of other beings and can locate them by following the energy trail they leave behind as he tracks their energy signature however it is unknown if he can sense and track the remnants of energy signatures.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Flight: </strong>Goten has the natural ability of flight however he was unaware of it until it was taught to him as all Saiyans have the natural ability of flight. Goten is able to fly extremely fast and has great control over his ability of flight as he can hover, move swiftly through the air performing aerobatic movements, levitate, spin swiftly through the air while maintaining, increasing or decreasing spin while maintaining areal balance and coordination. It is unknown if Goten can fly well in high atmospheric intense and harsh pressures, temperatures and environments however it is noted that Goten can perfectly maintain flight while battling an opponent.</p><p><b>Superhuman Agility:</b> Goten's Saiyan/Human hybrid physiology grants him superhuman agility, bodily coordination and balance greater than that of any human in the universe. Goten can perform complicated acrobatic movements while perfectly maintaining balance without effort and has on occasion performed circus-like movements during battle as he dodged and easily evaded very fast attacks that are unseen by the human eye.</p><p><b>Superhuman Stamina:</b> Goten's Saiyan/Human hybrid physiology produces less fatigue poisons than any human in the universe. Goten can engage in intense physical activity for days before his body begins the production of fatigue toxins and it impales his blood and body tiring him in the process.</p><p><b>Unarmed Combat:</b> Goten has some degree of experience and training in hand to hand combat and is an expert martial artist surprising even Goku and Gohan's expectations. Goten was trained by Goku, Gohan, Chi-Chi, Piccolo and trains with Trunks.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Gurd (Guldo in the English dub.) is the smallest and least powerful member of the Ginyu Force physically; a short, rotund green alien with four eyes (which prevents him from wearing a scouter like the other members). Though clearly the weakest member of the group, Gurd possesses some psychic abilities, including being able to stop time for as long as he can hold his breath.</p><p>He and the other members of the <a href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\">Ginyu Force</a> play a game of Janken at <a href=\"/captain-ginyu/4005-40734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40734\">Captain Ginyu</a>'s insistence to decide who gets to fight <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and who gets stuck with the \"trash,\" <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> and <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Kuririn</a>. <a href=\"/recoome/4005-40736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40736\">Reacoom</a> wins outright, and Gurd , as the runner-up, fights Gohan and Kuririn. Their speed and strength catch him off guard however, forcing him to resort to sneak attacks and time-freezing, and finally to use the full extent of his psychic powers to mentally paralyze their bodies, rendering them helpless. But as he prepares to finish them off Vegeta unexpectedly steps in and saves them by cutting off Gurd's head (in the manga this is done with a sideways chop, while in the anime Vegeta uses a ki beam). Gurd's severed head lives long enough to curse Vegeta for interfering, before the <a href=\"/saiyans/4060-47197/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47197\">Saiyan</a> prince blows the head up with another blast.</p><p>Later, in an anime-only arc, Gurd attacks <a href=\"/chao-zu/4005-19773/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\">Chaozu</a> while on <a href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\">North Kai\u014d</a>'s planet, only to be easily defeated like the rest of his group. Gurd also makes a small appearance in Dragonball GT and it shows him flying out of hell with the other villains.</p><p>Gurd's literal Japanese name is Gurudo and is either a take on y\u014dguruto (yogurt) or kurudo (curd). He's called Gurd in the VIZ manga to reflect the latter pun. He makes an appearance in the movie Fusion Reborn along with Recoome, <a href=\"/burter/4005-45718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45718\">Burter</a>, and <a href=\"/jeice/4005-40735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40735\">Jeice</a>.</p>",

To accomplish this goal, Zeus came to and seduced the mortal Queen Alcmena in the guise of her husband, King Amphitryon of Troezen. Alcmena gave birth to the baby boy who would one day come to be known as Hercules.

The infant Hercules provoked Hera's wrath by biting her while he fed. When Hera learned the infant was Hercules, the illegitimate demigod son of Zeus, and that Athena was responsible for him feeding at her breast, she swore vengeance on both Athena and the boy.

Upon completion of his labors Hercules' atonement was complete and he was freed from King Eurystheus' control.</p><p>Despite accomplishing his world-famous labors and ridding the mortal world of monsters, Hercules' greatest service to the Olympian Gods during his mortal life may have been fighting beside and defending them against the Giants who were then the newest and fiercest children of the <a href=\"/elder-gods/4060-52790/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52790\">Elder Goddess</a> Gaea. The fates prophesied that no God could slay them, only a mortal bearing the lion's sign. So when <a href=\"/gaea/4005-15778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15778\">Gaea</a> sent her newest race of children, the Giants, to overthrow Zeus and the Olympians, Hercules did what the Gods themselves could not; he slayed the Giants thus preventing the demise of the Olympian Gods while fulfilling an important part of his prophesied destiny as savior of the Gods and men.</p><p> </p><p>Interestingly, after Hercules had protected and preserved both mortal men and the Olympian Gods from all manner of monsters, creatures, beasts, titans and giants, it was Nessus, a common centaur, who ultimately caused Hercules' mortal demise through deception and trickery. <a href=\"/nessus/4005-58513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58513\">Nessus</a> kidnapped Hercules' wife Deianeira, whereupon Hercules shot him with an arrow that had been dipped in the poisonous blood of the Hydra, fatally wounding him. Feigning a wish to make amends while wanting to exact revenge on Hercules, the dying centaur told Deianeira how to make a love charm from his allegedly enchanted blood, aware that it was now tainted with the lethal poison of the Hydra. Some time after Nessus' death, Deianeira, distraught over her husband's latest infidelity, rubbed the supposed love charm into Hercules' shirt and put it on him while he slept. Hercules was instantly thrown into unbearable agony. Hercules built a funeral pyre, set it aflame and threw himself upon it in an attempt to burn the poison out of his body. As his mortal body burned, Hercules plunged for three days through the abyss to <a href=\"/tartarus/4020-55900/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55900\">Tartarus</a> (the lowest and harshest part of the underworld). Zeus finally intervened; consuming the pyre with his thunderbolts, splitting the divine part of Hercules away from his mortal shade and bringing Hercules to Olympus to be made a true immortal. The first mortal ever to be made a God. Shortly after Hercules' ascension from being a demigod to full godhood Zeus tried to make peace between Hera and Hercules by wedding Hercules to Hera's favored daughter <a href=\"/hebe/4005-46892/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46892\">Hebe</a>, Goddess of Youth. Despite the many infidelities of Hercules the marriage of Hercules and Hebe endures till this very day, which is not uncommon for Olympian Gods and Goddesses.</p><h3>Before the Age of Marvels</h3><p>Very little is known about the activities of Hercules between his apothesization by Zeus and the modern 'Age of Marvels.' It is known, however, that after leading a mortal life of high adventure he eventually found life on Olympus to be dull and boring. Hercules craved action and excitement in the form of adventure and battle like he'd experienced during his mortal demigod days on Earth. It was during this period of time that Hercules first met and battled his future friend, companion, confidant and fellow <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avenger</a>; <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> several times.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027177\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027177-hercules_vs_thor___annual__1_panel_01_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0528634361233\" data-width=\"227\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 227px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027177-hercules_vs_thor___annual__1_panel_01_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027177\"><img alt=\"Hercules &amp; Thor - the first meeting\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\" data-width=\"227\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027177-hercules_vs_thor___annual__1_panel_01_color_lrg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027177-hercules_vs_thor___annual__1_panel_01_color_lrg.jpg 227w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules &amp; Thor - the first meeting\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027177-hercules_vs_thor___annual__1_panel_01_color_lrg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027177-hercules_vs_thor___annual__1_panel_01_color_lrg.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px\" data-width=\"227\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules &amp; Thor - the first meeting</figcaption></figure><p>The first of these encounters took place in Olympus when Thor was inadvertently transported there by a long forgotten, ancient portal between <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> and Olympus. Upon arriving in Olympus, Thor did a brief bit of exploring before deciding to return to Asgard. While seeking a way home he crossed paths with Hercules when both wanted to use the same narrow foot bridge from opposite sides of a river. Hercules called for Thor to wait until he'd crossed first but Thor, his pride apparently provoked at the thought of going second, instead began to rush across the the bridge in deliberate defiance of Hercules. Shocked by Thor's defiance, the equally prideful Hercules physically upended the bridge, dumping Thor into the river. Thor arose from the water while defiantly taunting Hercules. In response, Hercules tossed gigantic boulders at Thor which he dodged while climbing from the river. It was then then that the battle truly commenced as the two braggarts traded threats and insults in addition to blows. As they fought, each continually surprised the other with his incredible strength, stamina and fighting prowess. It became apparent to they were evenly matched. Still, neither god, both proud and stubborn, had ever before met his equal in strength or battle so neither would admit it now. Trading ever harder blows, they fought on; each certain that he was actually the mightier warrior and would thus emerge victorious. The battle only ended when Zeus, ruler of Olympus and Hercules' father, intervened, ending the battle.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027154\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027154-hercules___vs_thor__1st_fight.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.510067114094\" data-width=\"149\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 149px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027154-hercules___vs_thor__1st_fight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027154\"><img alt=\"The first battle between Hercules and Thor.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px\" data-width=\"149\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027154-hercules___vs_thor__1st_fight.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027154-hercules___vs_thor__1st_fight.jpg 149w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The first battle between Hercules and Thor.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027154-hercules___vs_thor__1st_fight.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027154-hercules___vs_thor__1st_fight.jpg 149w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 149px) 100vw, 149px\" data-width=\"149\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The first battle between Hercules and Thor.</figcaption></figure><p>Zeus, who'd witnessed their battle, told Hercules and Thor they'd fought honorably and were both deserving of victory. Kneeling before him out of respect, Hercules and Thor paid homage to Zeus. Zeus told them to make peace. Hercules and Thor then shook hands after which Zeus transported Thor back to Asgard and sealed the ancient portal between there and Olympus shut.</p><p>The second time Hercules and Thor met was when Thor and the <a href=\"/warriors-three/4060-33600/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-33600\">Warriors Three</a> of Asgard were on a quest to obtain several mythological artifacts, including the Pigskin of <a href=\"/dionysus/4005-14561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14561\">Dionysus</a> which has the power to turn rivers into wine. When Thor and his companions sought to borrow the pig from Dionysus (now aged and haggard from not having access to his wine) they learned the pig was in the possession of Hercules who was using it to create an endless supply of wine which he drank and shared with a bevy of beautiful women.</p><p>Coming upon Hercules in the midst of this revelry, Thor approached him in peace and asked him for the pig. Despite having met him before, Hercules somehow failed to recognize Thor and refused to give the pig to him. Dionysus then spoke, telling Hercules he was now in the company of Thor and no longer desired his company or friendship. These words provoked Hercules who ushered the beauteous women out of harms way before splashing the river of wine onto Thor and dealing him a mighty blow which sent him flying into the tops of the surrounding trees. As Thor came down from the treetops and the battle was joined, several <a href=\"/olympian-gods/4060-44825/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44825\">Olympian Gods</a> (including Zeus and <a href=\"/neptune/4005-13899/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13899\">Neptune</a>) watched, placing wagers on the outcome. Hercules and Thor battled mightily against one and other, using many brutal techniques while ceaselessly bragging and trading insults. The tide of battle swung back and forth, with Thor eventually hurling Hercules high into the air where he was admonished by Zeus for being arrogant and lazy. Diving back to earth, Hercules readied his mightiest blow. On the ground Thor prepared in kind. When Hercules returned to earth, he and Thor struck simultaneously with their fists colliding and creating an tremendous shockwave that scattered the Warriors Three, the beauteous women, the magic pig and the river of wine in every direction. The force of the blow also created an enormous crater beneath them. The two heroes, both now barely conscious, struggled to get up and renew their battle. Hercules recovered first, quickly putting Thor in a chokehold.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1597919\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.62569444444444\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1597919\"><img alt=\"Hercules - choking Thor in hand-to-hand combat.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg 1440w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - choking Thor in hand-to-hand combat.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg 1440w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1597919-hercules_vs_thor___headlock_large.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - choking Thor in hand-to-hand combat.</figcaption></figure><p>Finding he was physically unable to break free from Hercules' grip, Thor mused about his predicament; even admitting to himself that Hercules is his better in hand-to-hand combat. At that point, while on the brink of unconsciousness, Thor's musings reminded him of his power over the storm which he then used to create a storm and bring down a powerful lightning bolt upon Hercules. The lightning struck Hercules forcefully, breaking his grip and freeing Thor. Hercules claimed Thor cheated by using his elemental powers. Thor countered that using his weather powers was the same as Hercules using his arms. Fandral and Volstagg, of the Warriors Three, declared the fight a draw as Dionysus drank the wine created by his pig to regain his youthful vitality and the Olympians watching from above offered their opinions to each other. Thor was rejuvenated by the rain from the storm he'd created as Hercules relinquished Dionysus' pig and, vowing to never again forget Thor's name or face, scooped up two arm-loads of beauteous women and strode away.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1158020\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png\" data-ratio=\"0.68901734104046\" data-width=\"865\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 865px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1158020\"><img alt=\"Drinking Contest: Hercules &amp; Thor vs frost giants.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png 865w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Drinking Contest: Hercules &amp; Thor vs frost giants.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png 865w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1158020-thor_herc_drinking01.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Drinking Contest: Hercules &amp; Thor vs frost giants.</figcaption></figure><p>Yet another meeting between Hercules and Thor occurred when Hercules traveled to Asgard using the same portal Thor had once used to enter Olympus. He came to Asgard (against the wishes of Zeus) in search of Asgardian giants whom he thought somehow related to the Olympian giants and thus a threat to Olympus and mankind. Hercules found and began battling some Asgardian giants causing tremors that reached all the way to the halls of Asgard. Concerned about these tremors, Odin, ruler of Asgard, sent Thor to investigate their origin. Thor discovered the cause of the tremors to be Hercules battling <a href=\"/frost-giants/4060-57102/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57102\">Frost giants</a>. Recognizing each other, Hercules and Thor exchanged verbal barbs as they, presumably, prepared to battle the Frost giants together. Thor, thinking Hercules was about to attack, insisted he be the first to engage their foes but Hercules stopped him, explaining that he'd already arranged a different kind of contest; a drinking contest. Hercules and Thor then proceeded to drink one giant bottle of ale after another, matching the Frost giants drink for drink, bottle for bottle for hours on end. Eventually, Hercules and Thor won when all of the Frost giants were unconscious; passed out drunk. All, that is, except the female Frost giants, whom then picked up and carried the two drunken gods away for private matters, matters which still remain untold.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-612343\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0327137546468\" data-width=\"1345\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1345px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:103.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-612343\"><img alt=\"Hercules and Thor battle during the God War.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" data-width=\"929\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 1345w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 929w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules and Thor battle during the God War.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 1345w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 929w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" data-width=\"929\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules and Thor battle during the God War.</figcaption></figure><p>The final known pre-Marvel Age meeting of these two mythic warrior-gods brought about a \"God War\" between Olympus and Asgard. The events leading up to this war began when Thor responded to the prayers of his Viking worshipers whom sought his aid against some Greek forces. Thor answered the Viking prayers, intervening on their behalf and turning the tide of battle in their favor. Realizing the godly intervention the vikings had received was beyond their ability to combat, the Greeks responded by praying to their own champion, Hercules, who answered their prayers by promptly arriving and engaging Thor in battle. Such was the ferocity of the raging battle between Hercules and Thor that it caused both the Greeks and the Vikings to quit the field of battle, running for safety. The two godly warriors traded blows of fists, hammer and mace. They used boulders and trees as mortal men use normal weapons, fighting viciously and relentlessly. Neither Hercules nor Thor gave an inch of ground, yet, despite their best efforts, neither could gain a decisive advantage over the other. Thor finally called a stop to the battle by suggesting to Hercules that they have a temporary truce until meeting once again one week later, at such time when they would both be accompanied by the armies of their respective realms, and then renew their struggle to determine whom was mightier and which side would be victorious. Hercules agreed to the truce and both he and Thor returned to their home realms where each sought his father's approval of this war they had agreed to. Thor's father <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin</a> refused his petition for war and Hercules was likewise rebuffed by his father Zeus. Nonetheless, thanks to the machinations of <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a>, Asgardian God of Mischief, the will of Zeus was swayed and war between Olympus and Asgard became imminent.</p><p>Olympus and Asgard both marshaled their forces and, when the week-long truce was ended, the two sides met on the field of battle; the Olympians led by Hercules and the Asgardians led by Thor. Olympian fought Asgardian, Ares fought Balder and, naturally, Hercules and Thor renewed their battle. While the war raged, sky-fathers Zeus and Odin discreetly met and determined how it would end. Two days later the war was over with, due to the power and determination of Zeus and Odin, both sides believing they had won despite neither being able to reap any benefit from their apparent victory.</p><p>After these, and possibly other untold encounters, Hercules and Thor have been friends, rivals, allies and teammates. They've related to each other; both knowing what it's like to be the son of an overbearing all-powerful ruler, both being the champion of his realm and both having an undeniable affinity for earthly mortals. Hercules and Thor each believe himself to be stronger than the other and have engaged in friendly arm-wrestling matches against each other many times over the centuries. Ironically, these friendly contests of strength have proven nothing as all have ended in stalemate. The friendship of Hercules and Thor has been described as being so close it's as though they are brothers.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618090\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.80645161290323\" data-width=\"372\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 372px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618090\"><img alt=\"The model for Marvel's Hercules: Steve Reeves\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg 372w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The model for Marvel's Hercules: Steve Reeves\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg 372w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618090-smc___marvel___hercules___steve_reeves_8.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The model for Marvel's Hercules: Steve Reeves</figcaption></figure><p>The Marvel version of Hercules was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/journey-into-mystery-annual/4050-19069/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19069\">Journey into Mystery Annual\" #1</a> in 1965 as the champion and mightiest of the Olympian Gods who battles Asgard's mightiest warrior; Thor.</p><p>A household name; Hercules is one of the most popular figures from Greco-Roman mythology and is universally known for his immense strength. In the late 1950's and early 1960's Hercules was a well known and very popular myth-based hero in many \"sword and sandal\" movies. He'd been played by several actors in these movies, but was most notably portrayed by champion bodybuilder and former Mr. Universe Steve Reeves, upon whom Jack Kirby based his design and depiction of Hercules. Lee and Kirby's decision to create a Marvel version of Hercules to combat Thor made sense considering his mythological roots, his strength, his built-in name recognition and the popularity of \"Hercules\" movies at the time. Marvel's Hercules first appeared during the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">Silver Age of Comics</a> in the first and only \"Journey into Mystery Annual\" in the summer of 1965.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Into the Marvel Universe</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2086391\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4611111111111\" data-width=\"540\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 540px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2086391\"><img alt=\"Hercules: Circa 1967\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-width=\"438\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg 540w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg 438w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules: Circa 1967\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg 540w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2086391-hercules___don_heck_based_on_steve_reeves_crisp___clear_color.jpg 438w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" data-width=\"438\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules: Circa 1967</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules appears as a character very similar to Thor in strength, nobility, pride, divine origin, demeanor and his relationship with his father. In subsequent early appearances, during battles against both Thor and the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, Hercules is shown to have a more carefree attitude and to be more reckless than Thor. These characteristics are what what differentiated him Thor the most. Later, when he was exiled from <a href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\">Olympus</a>, Hercules filled the role of strongman and deity as a member of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> for a time. During this, his first stint as an Avenger, Hercules was shown to be a brooding type who longs to return to Olympus. It's also during this stint as an Avenger that Hercules' skill as a ladies' man was first hinted at when he dated the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> and also when the <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a>, who usually makes her opponents fall in love with her, becomes enamored with him. As one of the earliest Avengers, Hercules faced several of their earliest foes such as the <a href=\"/super-adaptoid/4005-10861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10861\">Super-Adaptoid</a>, <a href=\"/dragon-man/4005-6823/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6823\">Dragon Man</a>, the <a href=\"/mad-thinker/4005-2131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2131\">Mad Thinker</a>, <a href=\"/alexei-shostakov/4005-7581/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7581\">Red Guardian</a>, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> and <a href=\"/executioner/4005-3517/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3517\">Skurge the Executioner</a> before he battled and defeated the Olympian Gods' deadliest enemy: Typhon and thereby rescuing his father Zeus and the rest of the Olympian gods from the extra-dimensional realm Typhon had banished them to. In light of Hercules defeating Typhon and saving him and his fellow gods, Zeus decreed Hercules' exile to be over. Glad that his exile was over and happy to be back in his father's good graces, Hercules bid farewell to his teammates and left the Avengers to return to Olympus where he could be with his Olympian brethren.</p><h3>Champions</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618113\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5593220338983\" data-width=\"590\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618113\"><img alt=\"Hercules stars in the Champions\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg 590w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg 410w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules stars in the Champions\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg 590w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1618113-champions____1.jpg 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules stars in the Champions</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules characterization in the Bronze Age was still quite similar to that of Thor. He continued to be depicted as immensely prideful and confident. Hercules appeared as a recurring character in \"Thor\" during the early 1970's where he first battled against and then partnered with Thor for a lengthy period. Together they faced a multitude of powerful adversaries including; the <a href=\"/destroyer/4005-7940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7940\">Destroyer</a>, Pluto, Ares, the <a href=\"/dweller-in-darkness/4005-13999/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13999\">Dweller in the Darkness</a>, <a href=\"/firelord/4005-7108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7108\">Firelord</a>, <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> and <a href=\"/ego/4005-19936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19936\">Ego the Living Planet</a>. This added exposure garnered Hercules enough popularity to allow him to become the lead character in a short-lived group/team comic called \"the <a href=\"/champions/4060-40413/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40413\">Champions.</a>\" This series was set in Los Angeles.</p><p>This was the first time Hercules became the main focus of a comic and the major hero on a team. It was also here where Hercules' nature as an impulsive hero became more established and expounded upon. The Champions battled for justice for a relatively short period before disbanding due to a lack of cohesiveness amongst the various members. During his time with the Champions, Hercules faced foes such as the <a href=\"/stranger/4005-13332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13332\">Stranger</a>, the <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a>, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a>, <a href=\"/stuart-clarke/4005-15416/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15416\">Rampage</a>, <a href=\"/titanium-man/4005-13823/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13823\">Titanium Man</a>, <a href=\"/crimson-dynamo/4005-7234/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7234\">Crimson Dynamo</a>, the <a href=\"/griffin/4005-15386/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15386\">Griffin</a> and <a href=\"/swarm/4005-1945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1945\">Swarm</a>.

These mini-series are both set in the future and focus on the prospect of Hercules learning true humility. It's here that Hercules is cast as a humorous character for the first time as he's shown as an affable and gregarious hero who's just as likely to goof up as save the day. The success of these mini's gave Hercules a boost in popularity that lead to him rejoining the Avengers in the present. During this stint as an Avenger, Hercules battled foes such as the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\">Beyonder</a>, <a href=\"/terminus/4005-14542/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14542\">Terminus</a>, the <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls</a>, <a href=\"/maelstrom/4005-2493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2493\">Maelstrom</a>, <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang</a>, Kang's <a href=\"/growing-man/4005-2266/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2266\">Growing Man</a> and the <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a>. It's also during this stint as an Avenger that Hercules' use of alcohol was shown and used as a weakness when he was ganged-up on and beaten down by a group of super-strong members of the Masters of Evil after he'd been drugged by <a href=\"/black-mamba/4005-30719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30719\">Tanya Seely (Black Mamba)</a> while drinking. After recovering from his injuries, Hercules aided the Avengers as a reservist against the <a href=\"/high-evolutionary/4005-13346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary</a>.

Hercules also fought to stop the Kree-Shi'ar War during <a href=\"/operation-galactic-storm/4045-27758/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-27758\">Operation: Galactic Storm</a>. A new facet of Hercules' persona was shown when he mentored fellow Avenger <a href=\"/thunderstrike/4005-7611/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7611\">Eric Masterson</a>, who'd temporarily assumed the identity of Thor, on the use of his powers and the ways of heroism. By the mid-90's, Hercules came into conflict with his father Zeus over his callous disregard for the feelings of others in his cruel machinations and manipulations, specifically the creation and use of the woman/construct <a href=\"/taylor-madison/4005-48456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48456\">Taylor Madison </a>as a tool to be used against Hera. Hercules was emotionally scarred by these events and defiantly stood up to Zeus. Predictably, Zeus reacted with fury and stripped Hercules of his immortality as well as half of his power as punishment for his impudence. This lead to Hercules having to face threats and foes as a mortal again which put him at greater risk of injury and/or death and tempered his usual bluster for a time.</p><h3>Onslaught and Heroes for Hire</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242823\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.0648967551622\" data-width=\"339\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 339px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:206.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242823\"><img alt=\"Hercules during his 'Heroes for Hire' days\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" data-width=\"309\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg 339w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg 309w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules during his 'Heroes for Hire' days\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg 339w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/242823-135682-hercules.jpg 309w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" data-width=\"309\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules during his 'Heroes for Hire' days</figcaption></figure><p>While stripped of his divinity Hercules continued to fight as an Avenger, but was absent when the team fell, seemingly slain, to <a href=\"/onslaught/4005-13352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13352\">Onslaught</a> (he was accompanying his special friend and fellow Avenger, <a href=\"/deathcry/4005-7231/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7231\">Deathcry</a>, on her journey back to her home world in the <a href=\"/shiar-empire/4020-23199/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23199\">Shi'ar Empire</a>). Hercules' loyalty and dedication to his missing teammates was evident when he decided to return to Olympus and, if necessary, force Zeus to reveal the true fate of the Avengers. To this end he tried to enlist the aid of the Hulk, but the Hulk refused. Hercules didn't accept his refusal and attempted to make the Hulk to help him by force of arms. With Hercules' power significantly diminished, the Hulk beat him nearly to death before Zeus intervened. After recovering from his injuries, Hercules was given the chance to regain his lost divinity and strength, but instead, to Zeus' profound surprise, wanted only to know the fate of the fallen Avengers. Even the power of Zeus proved unable to discern the fate of the Avengers, but Hercules' efforts showed in him a measure of character and selflessness seldom seen before. Hercules even joined <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> briefly serving as an agent to prevent the machinations of Ares and his <a href=\"/warhawks/4060-58348/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58348\">Warhawks</a>. Still unable to locate his fallen friends, the Avengers, Hercules over-indulged in alcohol attempting to escape his guilt for both not being present when they fell and for not being able to ascertain their fate. During this bout with alcoholism, Hercules joined the newly formed super team \" <a href=\"/heroes-for-hire/4060-23588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\">Heroes for Hire</a>\" which had been founded, funded and lead by <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>.

Hercules' step-mother Hera took advantage of the situation by trying to thoroughly humiliate him and destroy his heroic reputation while he was in this vulnerable state. To accomplish this she enlisted the aid of Hercules' cousin and ancient rival Eurysteus, recalling him from the underworld to set up a modern twelve labors for Hercules to perform on a reality television show. These labors were designed to be as impossible as the original twelve Hercules performed in ancient times. They included capturing <a href=\"/ka-zar/4005-3558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3558\">Ka-Zar's</a> sabretooth tiger partner <a href=\"/zabu/4005-3537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3537\">Zabu</a>, the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhuman</a> watch-dog <a href=\"/lockjaw/4005-3534/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3534\">Lockjaw</a>, snaring Dragon Man, defeating the <a href=\"/abomination/4005-3489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3489\">Abomination</a>, Acquiring <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\">Captain America's shield</a>, retrieving a <a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier</a> and facing his dead wife Megara in Hades to obtain her forgiveness. Hera was certain Hercules would fail, but he completed these new labors, thus restoring his public reputation and renewing his lust for life.</p><p>Also happening during this period of his life, despite being represented by the <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a>, who specialized in cases involving super humans, Hercules was successfully sued by the super-villain <a href=\"/constrictor/4005-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2127\">Constrictor</a> for for damages due to injuries the villain incurred when Hercules stopped him during the active commission of a crime; beating him up in the process. Hercules lost all his money paying this fine and subsequently had to work as a laborer for <a href=\"/damage-control/4060-4951/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4951\">Damage Control</a> to make a living. Hercules' financial troubles were short-lived, however, as he won back nearly all of his fortune a short time later by beating the Constrictor in a poker tournament held by Benjamin J. Grimm, a.k.a. the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a>.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>When the super team known as the <a href=\"/new-warriors/4060-11896/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11896\">New Warriors</a> tried to apprehend some fugitive super villains, while filming their efforts for a potential reality television show, one of those villains, <a href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\">Nitro</a>, exploded while battling New Warrior <a href=\"/namorita/4005-2113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2113\">Namorita</a> and caused a bus to explode killing hundreds of school children. In the wake of this tragedy the public outcry against super-powered people was immense leading to the United States government passing a law requiring all super-powered citizens to make their identities and powers known to the government. The law also required them to train and use their abilities in the service and at the direction of the U.S. federal government. The law was called the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Super-Human Registration Act</a>. Many heroes complied and registered, but many heroes did not. Most prominent amongst those who chose not to register was <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>. The government could not abide people who were required to register not doing so and they soon ordered the newly registered super-humans to arrest the now-fugitive non-compliant super-humans, often pitting friends against friends. This lead to the the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Superhero Civil War</a> which pitted former friends and allies against each other and even put super villains who had registered on the right side of the law when they confronted and battled their respective heroic foes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1689631\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.55\" data-width=\"560\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1689631\"><img alt=\"Hercules puttin' the smackdown on Ragnarok\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg 560w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg 412w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules puttin' the smackdown on Ragnarok\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg 560w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/1689631-hercules_vs_thor___civil_war_ragnarok_2.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules puttin' the smackdown on Ragnarok</figcaption></figure><p>During the Civil War, Hercules became a part of Secret Avengers, joining Captain America and fighting in opposition of the Super-Human Registration Act. Captain America's forces were largely street-level heroes so the addition of Hercules brought a lot of much needed power to their side. Hercules proved invaluable to Cap's team at least twice. The first time was when Cap's team was lured into a false rescue situation set up by Iron Man, who lead the registered super-human forces. The Secret Avengers responded to the false emergency only to find themselves outnumbered by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> and his team. Cap and Iron Man spoke briefly before a full-blown battle erupted. For a time Cap's side held their own, but things started to go bad when Captain America was on the verge of being beaten by Iron Man. Seeing Cap's desperate situation, Hercules fought his way through several super-strong opponents and was attempting to rescue Captain America when <a href=\"/ragnarok/4005-47573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47573\">Ragnarok</a> (a cybernetic clone of Thor) brutally attacked, striking Hercules down with massive amounts of lightning. The battle continued and Ragnarok soon killed <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath (Bill Foster</a>). This brutal killing shocked everyone present, temporarily stopping the battle and even swaying some heroes to change sides. With the battle on hold, Hercules used to opportunity to strike Iron Man with a fuel tanker-truck and rescue the badly beaten Captain America. The non-registered heroes then made their escape with the unexpected help of the Invisible Woman who was appalled by the actions and very existence of Ragnarok.</p><p>Hercules' second key moment of the Civil War came during the final battle when he finally got his chance to face Ragnarok, who was arguably the pro-registration side's most powerful and dangerous weapon, one on one without first being struck unexpectedly. Hercules and Ragnarok battled fiercely, but Hercules eventually got the upper hand and even used Ragnarok's own hammer to strike the final blow; breaking open the clone's head and incapacitating him. It was also during this final battle that Captain America once again fought Iron Man. This time Cap was on the verge of defeating Iron Man when several average citizens intervened on Iron Man's behalf. Having the common man take Iron Man's side and seeing the collateral damage the final battle had wrought caused Cap to have a change of heart. He surrendered and ended the Civil War. Hercules, however, still did not register and remained a fugitive.</p><p>In World War Hulk, Hercules was recruited by <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a>, the seventh smartest person in the world, to join his group of Renegades for the purpose of trying to help the Hulk.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-320840\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/320840-159932-hercules.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.435\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/320840-159932-hercules.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-320840\"><img alt=\"Hercules battling Ikaris\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" data-width=\"445\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/320840-159932-hercules.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/320840-159932-hercules.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules battling Ikaris\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/320840-159932-hercules.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/320840-159932-hercules.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" data-width=\"445\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules battling Ikaris</figcaption></figure><p>After Hercules convinced Amadeus Cho that taking SHIELD down was wrong, they went to Hercules' sister Athena's house in Vermont to lay low for a while. Athena advised Hercules to look over Cho as he was at crossroads and could one day become an effective hero or an unstoppable villain. Athena, Cho and Hercules then went to San Francisco for a meeting of the <a href=\"/council-of-godheads/4060-48159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48159\">Council of Godheads</a> in the shadow of the Dreaming Celestial.</p><p>While driving across the country from Vermont to San Francisco, Athena used the time to get acquainted with Cho. She told him some of the Olympian Gods' history, gave him some background info about Hercules and insight into what he's capable of. Hercules saw the road-trip as an occasion to party, most notably in Cleveland where he battled the gigantic Celtic demigod; <a href=\"/bran-the-blessed/4005-65628/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65628\">Bran</a>, the Blessed and romanced the She-Hulk.</p><p>Hercules, Cho and Athena eventually arrived in San Francisco where they encountered the <a href=\"/ikaris/4005-13967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13967\">Ikaris</a> and <a href=\"/thena/4005-13822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13822\">Thena</a>, two <a href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\">Eternals</a> who were working for the <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/4005-22836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\">Dreaming Celestial</a>. The two Eternals mistook Hercules for the Eternal known as <a href=\"/gilgamesh/4005-29157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29157\">Gilgamesh</a>, the Forgotten One (Gilgamesh had actually performed one of Hercules' twelve labors; the cleaning of the Augean stables) and tried to convince Hercules he was Gilgamesh. It turned out that the Eternal <a href=\"/makkari/4005-13945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13945\">Makkari</a> had made an error in translating the Celestial's message, the Celestials were expecting forgotten ones but did not mean Hercules was actually the \"Forgotten One.\" Thena, still not sure whom they were referring to, asked Athena. Athena merelynreplied \"Wouldn't you like to know?\".</p><p>When the Eternals had departed Athena called a meeting of the Council of Godheads to discuss a grave threat to earth; the Skrull's secret invasion. She then advised the Council to send their own invasion force to attack and slay the Skrull pantheon of gods in their own realm, thus preventing them from commanding the Skrulls to conquer Earth. Athena suggested Hercules, accompanied by Amadeus Cho, lead the Council's invading force of divine representatives consisting of <a href=\"/snowbird/4005-8474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8474\">Snowbird</a>, Tecumotzin (actually the Eternal <a href=\"/ajak/4005-34946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34946\">Ajak</a>), <a href=\"/mikaboshi/4005-44368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44368\">Amatsu-Mikaboshi</a>, and <a href=\"/atum-the-god-eater/4005-41842/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41842\">Atum</a> the God Eater. Hercules was reluctant to lead the newly formed and aptly named <a href=\"/the-god-squad/4060-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55685\">God Squad</a> because he lacked confidence in his leadership abilities, but he finally accepted the role of leader when the African God Anasi inadvertently challenged his pride by stating Thor of Asgard (a longtime friend and rival of Hercules) would be a far more suitable leader. Hercules decision was sealed when he stated \"If you follow, I will lead!\" and the group responded by joining him in the \" God Squad.\" The new group then boarded their ship and embarked on their journey to the realm of the Skrull gods.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2382874\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2382874-hercules___god_squad_1st_line_up_color_23_lrg.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3818181818182\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2382874-hercules___god_squad_1st_line_up_color_23_lrg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2382874\"><img alt=\"The God Squad - 1st Line-up\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" data-width=\"694\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2382874-hercules___god_squad_1st_line_up_color_23_lrg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2382874-hercules___god_squad_1st_line_up_color_23_lrg.jpg 550w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The God Squad - 1st Line-up\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2382874-hercules___god_squad_1st_line_up_color_23_lrg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2382874-hercules___god_squad_1st_line_up_color_23_lrg.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" data-width=\"694\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The God Squad - 1st Line-up</figcaption></figure><p>Early in their journey through the dreamtime the God Squad battled Nightmare and acquired his map of the dreamtime. Now having the means to mount an assault on the Skrull gods, the team resumed their quest while Hercules connected with Snowbird romantically along the way. Cho's pup, discovered to be a Skrull spy, was consumed by Demogorge as the Squad arrived at the edge of the Skrull god's realm where they were immediately attacked by hoards of alien gods enthralled by the Skrull deities. During the ensuing battle they lost Snowbird.</p><p>Upon their arrival at the throne of <a href=\"/klybn/4005-56389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56389\">Kly'bn</a> and <a href=\"/slgurt/4005-57078/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57078\">Sl'Gur't,</a> Ajak openly rebelled against Hercules placing the blame for the loss of their companion firmly on his shoulders and doubting his ability to lead them to victory. Hercules allowed Ajak to assume command and battle Kly'bn. Ajak's power proved insufficient against Kly'bn and he was seemingly slain. Meanwhile, Atum, in his Demogorge form, battled and then swallowed Sl'Gur't whole but was quickly ripped apart from within when he was unable to absorb the power she contained. Parts of Atum's body exploded in all directions with one of his bones knocking Cho into the endless void of the Dreamtime.</p><p>Enraged by the loss of Cho (which was the boy genius' plan), Hercules cut loose and battled the Skrull god-head to a stand still (impressive since Kly'bn was the god-head and most powerful of the entire Skrull Pantheon, ruling over them and all their captured Pantheons). While they battled, Kly'bn tried and failed to convert Hercules to his cause. And although they were evenly matched, Hercules eventually gained the advantage and hurled Kly'bn onto Demogorge's spinal column (which was held by Snowbird, who'd returned and rescued Cho from the void), slaying him. A battle of shape-shifters simultaneously raged between Amatsu-Mikaboshi and Sl'Gur't. And although Atum met his end at her hands, Mikaboshi was able to defeat her. By defeating and slaying the Skrull's inspirational godhead and his mate, the Squad had broken the back-bone of their spirituality-motivated invasion. Only then did the surviving members of the God Squad (Hercules, Snowbird and Cho) return home.</p><h3>Love and War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545220\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545220-herc124_cov.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4186046511628\" data-width=\"602\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 602px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545220-herc124_cov.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545220\"><img alt=\"Hercules - Matching strength against Atlas\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" data-width=\"676\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545220-herc124_cov.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545220-herc124_cov.jpg 602w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - Matching strength against Atlas\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545220-herc124_cov.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/545220-herc124_cov.jpg 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" data-width=\"676\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - Matching strength against Atlas</figcaption></figure><p>In need of some rest and relaxation after defeating the Skrull deity Kly'Bn, Hercules, who had invited Namora and Amadeus Cho, took a vacation on a remote island where Hercules and Namora were able to privately romp. Unfortunately for the trio it wasn't long before they were attacked by a group of Amazons wielding modern military weapons. The <a href=\"/amazons/4060-55892/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55892\">Amazons</a> managed to capture Cho whom they needed to locate the Omphalos, an ancient Olympian artifact of immense power which can be used to alter reality, which they intended to use to become the world's dominant force. <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, the Sub-Mariner, joined the group and informed them of the capture of the Olympian sea god, patron deity of <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> and uncle of Hercules; <a href=\"/neptune/4005-13899/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13899\">Neptune</a>. The group found and rescued Neptune after which Namor took him back to Atlantis for medical treatment and care. Hercules and Namora then headed to the new Axis Mundi (the seat of earthly world power), in Washington D.C., to intercept and engage the Amazons. Once there they met up with Athena, rescued Cho and battled the Olympian Titan <a href=\"/atlas/4005-44940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44940\">Atlas</a>. Despite all their efforts, the Amazon leader <a href=\"/artume/4005-57594/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57594\">Artume</a>, the daughter of Hippolyta, now in possession of the Omphalos succeeded in using it to reshape the world into the Amazon-dominated one she envisioned.

In the course of these events, Hercules iwa shocked to discover Namora's fondest desire was for Namor to be her love. Hercules and Amadeus reunited and continued their travels after Athena used what remained of the Axis Mundi energies to undo the damage inflicted by Artume and restore reality.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>After helping defeat Chthon as members of the Mighty Avengers, Hercules and Amadeus met with Athena at Silly's Greek Diner where they are confronted by Hera and the monstrous Titan Typhon (whom she held in thrall). Hercules and Typhon nearly came to blows, but Silly's Greek Diner had been declared sanctuary for all Olympians, thus forbidding any violence between Gods while inside. Hera demanded that Athena recognize her as ruler of the Olympians and submit to her authority or, along with Hercules and Amadeus, be killed. When Athena refused, Hera told her the next time they met she'd kill her. She also hinted she'd already disposed of Athena's mortal champion; the New Warrior Aegis.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-789495\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/789495-inc_hercules_128_page_016.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.9067524115756\" data-width=\"311\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 311px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:190.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/789495-inc_hercules_128_page_016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-789495\"><img alt=\"Hercules fighting dirty against the Sentry\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" data-width=\"311\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/789495-inc_hercules_128_page_016.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/789495-inc_hercules_128_page_016.jpg 311w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules fighting dirty against the Sentry\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/789495-inc_hercules_128_page_016.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/789495-inc_hercules_128_page_016.jpg 311w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\" data-width=\"311\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules fighting dirty against the Sentry</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules, Amadeus and Athena's search for Aegis lead them to a warehouse where they found Aegis' dead body. Hera and her allies Typhon, Pluto, the Huntsman of Zeus and Delphyne Gorgon were waiting in the warehouse intent on ambushing Hercules and company but, before they could launch their assault, Norman Osborn's Avengers (most of whom were actually villains) arrived and attacked both sides. Hercules engaged the Sentry and Spider-Man (<a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a>) simultaneously for an extended period, holding his own throughout the battle, while Amadeus and Delphyne aided each other against Ms. Marvel (<a href=\"/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\">Moonstone</a>) and Hawkeye (<a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a>). After a time Amadeus convinced Hercules they would eventually lose and they should quit the fight. Hercules then provided a very public emergency requiring the Avengers response to maintain Osborn's heroic charade. The Avengers responded to the emergency while Hercules and his crew escaped.</p><p>Athena then prepared Hercules and Amadeus to enter Hades, while Pluto was absent, to rescue the only one powerful enough to stop Hera: Zeus. Hercules and Amadeus entered Hades through a casino in Atlantic City where they saw many fallen heroes including Aegis, who acted as their guide in the underworld. Amadeus used his genius to win enough money to pay for passage into Tartarus where Zeus was imprisoned.</p><p>Once in Tartarus, they found Zeus shackled and held by Pluto, Lord of Hades. Next, they are attacked by twelve deceased villains including the one responsible for Hercules' mortal demise; Nessus. Hercules fought the villains, eventually holding them off using the Hydra-poisoned blood of Nessus. As Hercules battled, Pluto stated Zeus would be tried for his crimes and offered to let Hercules leave the underworld with his step-father Amphitryon instead. Hercules was actually convinced to refuse this offer by Amphitryon and instead chose to attend the trial. Hercules in turn convinced Amadeus to take advantage of the opportunity to see his deceased family while in the underworld.</p><p>The trial began with Pluto blaming all manner of misfortune and atrocity on Zeus. Witnesses called during this trial included: Cronus (father of Zeus), Semele (former lover of Zeus), Typhon, Hercules and Zeus himself. The result of the trial was a guilty verdict for Zeus, whom was then sentenced to drink from the River Lethe and thus, lose his memory.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-859194\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.54609375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-859194\"><img alt=\"The mortal 'shade' of Hercules\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-width=\"620\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg 620w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The mortal 'shade' of Hercules\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg 1280w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/859194-inc_hercules_130_page_023.jpg 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-width=\"620\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The mortal 'shade' of Hercules</figcaption></figure><p>Ignoring Zeus' wishes, Hercules refused to recognize the court and rejected both their verdict and Pluto's sentence. Pluto's response was to bring forth Hercules' own mortal shade which, upon his mortal demise, had been relegated to Hades while Hercules was raised up to full-godhood. Hercules battled his mortal shade as Zeus and Pluto watched. Meanwhile, Amadeus found his parents and learned his sister hadn't died.</p><p>While watching Hercules battle on his behalf, Zeus was so moved by Hercules' devotion to him that he willingly drank from the River Lethe and was instantly transformed into a mass of glowing energy. Hercules saw this, immediately dispatched his mortal shade and pursued the energy-mass until they both emerged from the casino in Atlantic City where Athena waited. The energy-mass then struck the ground and became Zeus, bereft of his memory in the form of a boy. Amadeus then emerged from the casino and, angry that Athena hadn't told him his sister yet lived, refused to accompany Hercules anymore, deciding to go his own way instead.</p><h3>The Mighty Thorcules</h3><p>When the new trio (Hercules, Athena &amp; Zeus) left Atlantic City Hercules explained to Zeus (now a child with no memory) who he was and how he came to be in his current condition. They are then attacked by harpies sent by Hera. Athena separated from the group to fight them while Hercules escaped with Zeus. Hercules and Zeus soon encountered Balder the Brave, then the Lord of Asgard, who was fleeing from some dark elves and a troll. Hercules and Zeus acted on Balder's behalf, swiftly dealing with his pursuers. Balder explained that Alflyse, Queen of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, was planning to take advantage of Thor's exile from Asgard by conquering it. With Asgard weakened by the loss of Thor and in need of an equally mighty champion, Balder sought out Hercules to enlist his aid against Alflyse and the Dark Elves.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-805472\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4333333333333\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-805472\"><img alt=\"Thorcules: Hercules posing as Thor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg 669w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thorcules: Hercules posing as Thor\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/805472-50_incredible_hercules_132.jpg 669w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thorcules: Hercules posing as Thor</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules was reluctant to help at first because he didn't want to put the boy Zeus, in danger but was quickly swayed when shown the comely Queen's image. Balder further explained the Dark Elves must believe that Thor still served Balder and defended Asgard. To this end, Norn magic was used to disguise Hercules as Thor and his Adamantine mace as Thor's hammer Mjolnir. They then traveled to Washington, D.C. to use the Axis Mundi to access a portal to Svartalfheim. Balder stayed behind while Hercules and Zeus found the portal and entered Svartalfheim. Once they were gone, Balder revealed his true identity; Malekith the Accursed, former leader of the Dark Elves.</p><p>Upon entering Svartalfheim, Hercules and Zeus were immediately surrounded by a troll war party with whom they made an uneasy alliance against their common foe, Queen Alflyse. The alliance was brief, however, as the trolls betrayed and attacked them as soon as Alflyse's castle came into view. Hercules had no sooner defeated the trolls when he and Zeus were met by a contingent of Dark Elves which included Queen Alflyse herself. Hercules introduced himself as \"Thor\" and Zeus as his son, \"Moodi the Moody.\" Zeus asked Alflyse if she planned to conquer Midgard. She told him that under her rule the Dark Elves had renounced the aggressive foreign policy of her predecessor, Malekith.</p><p>Using his typical charm, Hercules complimented Alflyse on her eloquence and her beauty. Alflyse liked what she heard but expressed a need for proof that what he said was true. Alflyse told Hercules that she had heard Thor was banished from Asgard and his hammer was broken. Turning on the charm, Hercules responded \"I am Thor. And I assure you, my . . . hammer works just fine.\" Alflyse smiled and blushed, but still she required him to prove he was indeed Thor by performing a series of challenges.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1543773\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0768558951965\" data-width=\"1145\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1145px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1543773\"><img alt=\"Romance between Hercules and Queen Alflyse\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px\" data-width=\"891\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg 1145w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg 891w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Romance between Hercules and Queen Alflyse\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg 1145w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1543773-hercules_n_alflyse_3_partying_panel.jpg 891w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px\" data-width=\"891\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Romance between Hercules and Queen Alflyse</figcaption></figure><p>The first challenge began immediately when a giant forge dropped on the unsuspecting Hercules momentarily pushing him to the ground. He sprung up instantly and smashed the forge to pieces, much to Alflyse's obvious pleasure. The next challenge was a trial of wits. Hercules had to solve the most legendary endgame in three-storied elvish chess. He pondered the board and it's levels for a time and then, concluding he couldn't solve it, he \"accidentally\" knocked the entire board over. He then claimed victory through changing the rules to win the unwinnable. Though her advisor was unconvinced, Alflyse eagerly accepted Hercules' reasoning and called for the next challenge. The third challenge was test of character in which Hercules was surrounded and engaged by several Elven warriors. After the battle began, Alflyse pulled her dress up high to reveal her upper leg and inner thigh. Despite being in the midst of battle, Hercules couldn't resist looking at her sensual display and was struck soundly upon the head while distracted. Hercules admitted failure in this challenge, but Alflyse (who'd obviously wanted him to succeed) declared, \"Two out of three. Close enough.\"</p><p>So the challenges ended with Hercules successfully proving he was \"Thor\" and they celebrated into the night. Hercules and Alflyse celebrated together; getting better acquainted and spending the night together. Zeus, however, used the time to research and study the real Thor in the Elven library. The next morning Hercules woke up feeling quite proud of his \"diplomacy\" but was shocked to learn he was now married to Alflyse. It was then that she told him of her new plans to conquer first Midgard (Earth) and then Asgard to reclaim Thor's birthright, the Crown of Asgard, for him. She proclaimed this as she presented to Hercules her Dark Elf forces, assembled and ready to march.</p><p>The Elven invasion of Midgard was about to begin when they were confronted by the real Thor, disguised as Hercules to avoid accusations of deception, and the Warriors Three. Seeking to stop the invasion, Thor ordered Alflyse to disperse her forces. She questioned what right an Olympian had to intervene and the Warriors Three told her their old ally \"Hercules\" (actually Thor) was now defending Asgard and \"Thor\" (actually Hercules) could claim his birthright by defeating Asgard's new defender. They even offered a written compact to bind both sides to the deal. Queen Alflyse happily accepted the terms as she was quite certain her husband \"Thor\" would defeat \"Hercules.\"</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-885688\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4311111111111\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-885688\"><img alt=\"Hercules and Thor switch roles and fight\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px\" data-width=\"670\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg 670w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules and Thor switch roles and fight\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/885688-44_incredible_hercules_136.jpg 670w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px\" data-width=\"670\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules and Thor switch roles and fight</figcaption></figure><p>Before they battled, Hercules and Thor met and discussed the circumstances leading up to the predicament in which they found themselves. Hercules told Thor he was impersonating him at Balder's request. Thor had no knowledge of that, but reminded Hercules that in order to halt the invasion he, as \"Thor\" must lose their battle. Thor assured Hercules he wouldn't hurt him while telling him to make their \"fight\" convincing. Hercules, incited by Thor's words, struck first and the battle began. The two gods traded real blows, renewing their ancient rivalry for a time before Thor told Hercules to go down. Hercules told Thor that since the Dark Elves had seen what he could do, nothing Thor had yet done would convince them he'd honestly lost. He proceeded to bait Thor, telling him \"You're Hercules now. Live up to the name.\" Sufficiently goaded by Hercules, Thor struck decisively, giving Hercules the opportunity to concede defeat, which he did, stating; \"Mighty Thor has finally, definitively and completely been defeated by Hercules, the Lion of Olympus.\" Thor rolled his eyes and grunted. The battle was over.</p><p>The matter of the elven invasion now settled, Hercules and Thor relaxed and shared some mead while recovering from their battle. Suddenly, Malekith and his ally Grendell attacked, catching Hercules and Thor unprepared. Before anyone else could react, Zeus struck Grendell down with a mighty thunderbolt revealing his identity to all present including Alflyse. The truth now out, Alflyse chastised Hercules for deceiving her but admitted she was quite flattered by his desire for her and even more impressed by his ability to please her. The two of them joined hands and left together, returning to the castle for more private time, leaving the boy Zeus with Thor and the Warriors Three as a new celebration ensued, carrying on into the night.</p><h3>Assault on New Olympus</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921271\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/921271-8_assault_on_new_olympus_prologue_one_shot_1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4358108108108\" data-width=\"592\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 592px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/921271-8_assault_on_new_olympus_prologue_one_shot_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921271\"><img alt=\"The unlikely team of Hercules &amp; Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\" data-width=\"668\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/921271-8_assault_on_new_olympus_prologue_one_shot_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/921271-8_assault_on_new_olympus_prologue_one_shot_1.jpg 592w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The unlikely team of Hercules &amp; Spider-Man\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/921271-8_assault_on_new_olympus_prologue_one_shot_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/921271-8_assault_on_new_olympus_prologue_one_shot_1.jpg 592w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\" data-width=\"668\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The unlikely team of Hercules &amp; Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>While Hercules and the youthful Zeus were side-tracked to Svartalfheim, Athena began gathering allies with which to oust Hera from power. First she brought Amadeus Cho back to her side and then she tried, but failed, to recruit Aphrodite, the Olympian Goddess of Love, to her cause. Athena also informed Cho that she had similarly failed to recruit Apollo, Artemis and Dionysus as well. They decide to then contact Avengers Mansion where Hercules and Zeus have just arrived upon their return from Svartalfheim. Athena brought Hercules up to speed on what had occurred during his absence, informing him of Hera's plans and telling him his wife, Hebe - Olympian Goddess of Youth - had been cast out of New Olympus for betraying Hera. Hercules summoned all available Avengers and told them of the grave danger Hera's \"Continuum\" presented to Earth.</p><p>Before the Avengers, Athena and Zeus could decide or do anything to thwart Hera's machinations, Hercules decided to find his absent wife Hebe. Find her he did; kissing Peter Parker (Spider-Man). Consumed by jealousy from this sight; Hercules struck Parker and knocked him flying through the air and out of the building into an alley. Now out of public view, Parker used the opportunity to quickly change into Spider-Man. Hercules soon arrived in the alley where the two of them began to fight. Spider-Man did what he could but he was sorely out-classed. Their skirmish ended when Hercules buried Spider-Man beneath a multitude of cars weighing many tons and Hebe interceded before he could act further. Hercules and Hebe then made amends and she joined the forces aligned against Hera.</p><p>Now back at Avengers Mansion, Hercules and his allies used Hebe's inside knowledge of Hera's plans to devise a strategy to stop Hera before she could roll-out her master plan - Continuum. The group managed to sneak through Hera's defenses, infiltrating the Olympus Group's corporate/godly headquarters. The heroes were soon discovered, however, and the battle was joined when amazons, monsters, gods and goddesses attacked the heroes. Henry Pym fought Argus, the one-hundred eyed cyclops and Spider-Woman engaged the demon Lamia. USAgent battled Eris, Goddess of Discord, Wolverine battled against Cephalus, Huntsman of Olympus and Spider-Man fought the Olympian spider-goddess, Arachne. Cho found his love, Dephyne Gorgon, and tied to reason with her while Athena engaged Hera herself in battle. This left Hercules to contend with the mightiest and most dangerous of Hera's forces; the monstrous Typhon. The battle went badly for Hercules' side as Zeus was captured and all but Hercules and Cho were defeated.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023832\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.70300333704116\" data-width=\"899\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 899px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023832\"><img alt=\"Hercules leading the Avengers against New Olympus\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg 899w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules leading the Avengers against New Olympus\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg 899w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2023832-hercules___avengers_assault_on_olympus_line_up.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules leading the Avengers against New Olympus</figcaption></figure><p>Zeus was taken by Hera and Typhon into their innermost stronghold where Hera finally revealed \"Continuum\" to be an empty artificial universe made real by her godly power and nature.

Outside Hera's stronghold, Hercules and Cho tried to gain entry as they squabbled about who would save which of their fallen allies. Finally deciding to act together in breaching the stronghold, Hercules and Cho were captured by Hephaestus as they attempted to dig their way in from underground.

Hera's cold, hard-heart was warmed and softened by Zeus' words. Hera then, having heard what she'd always wanted to hear and having been promised what she wanted most, a faithful Zeus, ordered Typhon to stop the roll-out of Continuum. Typhon refused, calmly explaining he'd been born to destroy the Gods and it was his intent to do exactly that. Hera attempted to assert her control over Typhon but couldn't. No longer able to control Typhon, Hera attacked him with Zeus joining her in the attack. The attack, though fearsome, was to no avail for Typhon wore the Aegis of Zeus and was thus immune to all physical harm. Typhon then quickly slew Hera while purposely leaving Zeus alive so he could explain his hatred for him and their ancient enmity towards each other to the memory deprived Zeus. Once he'd finished telling Zeus these things, he slew him as well.</p><p>Though they weren't present at the time of Zeus' demise, Hercules and Cho became aware of it instantly when Athena, who'd been turned to stone previously, was struck and re-animated by the Thunderbolt of Zeus as she inherited it upon his death. Immediately following Athena's re-animation and inheritance, she, Hercules and Cho witnessed Thanatos, the Olympian death-god, guiding the shades/souls of Zeus and Hera on their journey to the underworld. Enraged by the day's events, Hercules was desperate to get to and stop Typhon while Cho was happy because Hercules, who was apparently supposed to die, now seemed safe. Athena and Cho then went to the aid of the defeated Avengers while Hercules, now able to gain access to the stronghold, went to confront Typon and stop Continuum.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030498\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4355555555556\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030498\"><img alt=\"The epic final battle of Hercules and Typhon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\" data-width=\"668\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg 668w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The epic final battle of Hercules and Typhon\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1030498-herc141.jpg 668w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\" data-width=\"668\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The epic final battle of Hercules and Typhon</figcaption></figure><p>Upon entering the Olympus' Group's stronghold, Hercules was saddened when he found his father's corpse. He had little time for grief, though, as Typon quickly appeared and the battle was joined. Hercules and Typhon fought savagely, raining blow after blow and strike after strike of incalculable force upon each other. The battle-tide shifted back and forth between the two behemoths, but Hercules finally gained the upper-hand. Preparing to deliver the killing blow, Hercules mustered all of his godly-strength, raised his Adamantine mace and used it to strike the all-but-defeated Typhon. Shockingly, Typhon was unharmed. It was Hercules who was struck by the force of his blow, severely injuring him. It was then that Typhon revealed he was wearing the Aegis to Hercules. Then it was Typhon who positioned himself to finish-off Hercules.</p><p>Before killing Hercules, however, the sadistic Typhon amused himself by using Hercules' mace to beat, break and cripple him. Finally tiring of beating the helpless Hercules, Typhon asked Hercules for any last words before he died. The thoroughly beaten and broken Hercules, now mumbling and slurring, drew Typhon close to hear his last words. When Typhon was close enough, Hercules pulled out a vile of water Cho had obtained from the River Lethe and put it in the monster's mouth. The water instantly took Typhon's memory causing him to no longer recognize Hercules. Confused, Typhon asked Hercules who he was. Hercules merely requested that the Titan end his pain and suffering. Typhon didn't know why, but he found pleasure in the thought of killing Hercules and so he agreed. He moved in to kill Hercules but left himself vulnerable and was instead killed by Hercules who used his unbroken arm and Adamantine mace to beat Typhon to death.</p><p>With Typon now dead, all that remained was for Hercules to shut down the machine rolling-out Continuum. As beaten, broken and injured as he was Hercules found himself struggling mightily at any attempt to move. Effectively crippled, Hercules was still trying to get to the machine when Athena appeared. Hercules rejoiced at the appearance of his beloved sister but was dismayed when she told him her plan for the future included him dying so Cho could replace him as the new 'Prince of Power.' To save the universe; Athena then destroyed the Continuum machine, sealing the new Continuum-universe off from this one, but seemingly killed Hercules by doing so. When Cho and the Avengers made their way to her, Athena told them that Hercules had been vaporized while saving the world by smashing the Continuum machine.</p><h3>The New Prince of Power</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026965\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2026965-hercules____fall_of_an_avenger_1_color.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4375\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2026965-hercules____fall_of_an_avenger_1_color.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026965\"><img alt=\"Heroes &amp; Friends gather to mourn Hercules\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2026965-hercules____fall_of_an_avenger_1_color.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2026965-hercules____fall_of_an_avenger_1_color.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Heroes &amp; Friends gather to mourn Hercules\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2026965-hercules____fall_of_an_avenger_1_color.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2026965-hercules____fall_of_an_avenger_1_color.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Heroes &amp; Friends gather to mourn Hercules</figcaption></figure><p>The day after his apparent death, there was a funeral service for Hercules at the Parthenon in Greece. Many Greek citizens attended, paying their respects to their ancient hero. The most notable attendees, however, were many of the heroes Hercules had befriended. Counted among these heroes were Amadeus Cho, Thor, <a href=\"/warriors-three/4060-33600/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-33600\">The Warriors Three</a> of Asgard, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, Bruce Banner, the Black Widow, Namora, Snowbird, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> and several others.</p><p>Many of these attending heroes eulogized Hercules by recounting stories times they had shared with Hercules. They described heroic adventures, personal insights and bedroom prowess. The last word went to Hercules' genius side-kick, young Amadeus Cho. Cho had barely spoken when Athena and the rest of the remaining major Olympian gods and goddesses suddenly appeared. Athena then informed Cho, and all present, that he was to be the new leader of the Olympus Group (under her guidance, of course). Cho started to speak, protesting Athena's edict, when <a href=\"/apollo/4005-13900/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13900\">Apollo</a>, Olympian God of Light, objected as well. Surprised by Apollo's objection, Athena tried to bait him into battle but, after a brief display of his godly power, Apollo instead challenged Athena to a battle of proxies. Athena accepted and promptly selected Cho to be her champion. Apollo responded by choosing <a href=\"/phobos/4005-45219/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45219\">Phobos</a>, God of Fear and son of the late Ares. The other attending gods then made their selections with <a href=\"/neptune/4005-13899/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13899\">Poseidon</a> choosing Namor for Athena's side and <a href=\"/artemis/4005-44938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44938\">Artemis</a> picking <a href=\"/skaar/4005-48518/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48518\">Skaar</a>, son of the Hulk for her twin brother Apollo's side. Next, Nyx, Olympian Goddess of the Night, selected Nightmare for Apollo while Hebe, Olympian Goddess of Youth and widow of Hercules, chose Bruce Banner to aid Cho. With the sides now chosen the battle commenced. Cho quickly gained the upper hand in his confrontation with Phobos and then, to the surprise of the Olympian gods, managed to unite both teams of proxies against them. The ensuing battle of mortal proxies against the gods who'd selected them lead to Cho gaining access to the Olympian underworld through Pluto, God of the Underworld. Cho went to the underworld seeking Hercules but was soon informed by Pluto's wife, <a href=\"/persephone/4005-22958/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22958\">Persephone</a> (Queen of the Underworld) that Hercules was not there. Realizing that Hercules' underworld absence meant he still lived, Cho resolved to find him. He accepted the Olympus Group leadership position from Athena so he could use all of it's earthly wealth and godly power to find Hercules.</p><p>The first thing Cho did as leader of the Olympus Group was hire Bruce Banner to help him invent and build a device called the 'Hercollider Synchrotron.' This device was designed and built to search the entire multiverse for Hercules at hyper-speed. Unfortunately, Cho soon learned that even at it's inconceivable rate of speed, it could still take roughly a billion-and-half years for the device to search the multiverse and find Hercules.</p><p>Cho was pondering a new way to locate Hercules when he was approached by <a href=\"/agamemnon/4005-25967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25967\">Vali Halfling (a.k.a. Agamemnon)</a>, son of <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> and former leader of the \"Pantheon.\" Vali told Cho that he had figured out how to attain full, all-powerful, undeniable godhood. He explained this was possible by combining Olympian Ambrosia, the Asgardian Apples of <a href=\"/idunn/4005-32545/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32545\">Idunn</a>, Spells from the <a href=\"/book-of-thoth/4055-56945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56945\">Book of Thoth</a> and the sacred <a href=\"/moon-cup-of-dhanvantari/4055-56951/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56951\">Moon-cup of Dhanvantari</a>. Vali also proposed that Cho join him to obtain these things and attain this higher level of being. Cho refused Vali's offer, deciding to get these objects by himself so he could use the power they would grant to find Hercules and bring him back. Cho's quest to obtain these mythological artifacts became a race when Vali sought to get them first.</p><p>While trying to secure the <a href=\"/apples-of-idunn/4055-56942/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56942\">Apples of Idunn</a> in Asgard, Cho found he'd arrived too late; Vali had already been there and had got them first. Before he could leave, however, Cho was confronted by and forced to battle Thor. Cho was soon defeated by Thor, but managed to convince the God of Thunder to let him go and even aid him in attempting to get the Spells from the Book of Thoth.</p><p>Unfortunately, Vali was got every ingredient except the Moon-cup of Dhanvantari first. While trying to get the Moon-cup first, Cho was defeated in battle with Vali. Seeking to get the Moon-cup while Cho was down, Vali left the objects he'd previously gathered unsecured in Cho's presence as he hastily tried to get the final ingredient. On his way to the Moon-cup, Vali was delayed by an attack from Delphyne Gorgon. This allowed Cho to get it first. He quickly combined the four ingredients and used them to attain the level of full, all-powerful and undeniable godhood.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2049028\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.89\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2049028\"><img alt=\"Sky-Father Hercules: The god of gods\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sky-Father Hercules: The god of gods\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2049028-hercules___sky_father_01.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sky-Father Hercules: The god of gods</figcaption></figure><p>Ironically, Cho's new found power included omniscience which quickly made clear to him that he was not the proper receptacle of this newly acquired, awesome power.

With Hercules now there, Cho transferred all of his newly acquired power to him making and calling Hercules the \"God of Gods.\" Their reunion was short-lived, though, as Hercules instantly sensed the grave and imminent threat of the Chaos King and immediately left to begin gathering heroes to meet this danger.</p><h3>Chaos War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1581937\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.6425\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1581937\"><img alt=\"Sky-Father Hercules vs Chaos King Mikaboshi\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg 1200w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sky-Father Hercules vs Chaos King Mikaboshi\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg 1200w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1581937-hercules_vs_chaos_king_01.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sky-Father Hercules vs Chaos King Mikaboshi</figcaption></figure><p>Shortly after acquiring his immense new powers, Hercules became aware, due to his omniscience, of Amatsu-Mikaboshi's continued existence as the Chaos King, his acquisition of power and his plan to return the entirety of existence to the state of nothingness from which it originated. Realizing the grave danger he presented, Hercules used his new-found omnipotence to gather and further empower Earth's superheroes to fight the Chaos King/Mikaboshi and his army of enslaved alien deities. Unfortunately when Hercules and his heroic forces launched their assault, the Chaos King used the power he'd acquired from Nightmare, Lord of the Dream Dimension, to put humanity into a trance-like state leaving only Hercules, Thor and Amadeus Cho to oppose him. The Chaos King also attacked all of the various aspects of the underworld/Hell and forced Death herself to flee causing the mass release of all the souls of the deceased back into the realm of the living while also keeping those who were dying, or normally should/would die, alive. Hercules then used his power to recruit to his cause several other very powerful non-mortal beings who'd also proven immune to the Chaos King's trance. These beings included the Eternal; Sersi, half-demon; Hellstorm, former sea nymph; Venus and even the Devourer of Worlds; Galactus (though, in this case, unwillingly) and his herald; the Silver Surfer. These beings joined Hercules, Thor and Cho in forming the second incarnation of the God Squad to stop the Chaos King and save the multiverse.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679898\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5847089487402\" data-width=\"1151\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1151px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679898\"><img alt=\"Hercules - finishing the Chaos King\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-width=\"605\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg 1151w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg 605w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - finishing the Chaos King\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg 1151w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1679898-hercules_vs_chaos_king_03_finishing_blow.jpg 605w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-width=\"605\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - finishing the Chaos King</figcaption></figure><p>It was soon revealed that Hercules' sister, Athena, was the Chaos King's accomplice which she became after deciding the current reality is irreparably metaphysically corrupt and wished to start fresh with a new universe, a new reality, after the Chaos King had finished destroying the current one. Amadeus, by then, was losing hope of stopping the spread of chaos and the end of all things but theorized that reality could be saved if it were transported to the \"Continuum\" universe Hera had created. Hercules was against the idea and argued they should go down fighting. Hercules was then confronted by Athena who, acting as an agent of the Chaos King, intended to kill him. Unknown to Athena, Herucles' already immense power had been even further increased by Gaea and Pele who had destroyed and recreated Hercules as a maintainer of the cycle of life. Now more powerful than ever, Hercules casually annihilated his attacking sibling. Hercules, now more powerful than ever, then used his awesome power to confront and fight the Chaos King in an epic battle of universal proportions. Hercules was wounded during the battle but was able to hurt the Chaos King in kind. Eventually, with some help of the Hulk Squad, the <a href=\"/dead-avengers/4060-57910/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57910\">Dead Avengers</a> and even the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>; Hercules, Amadeus Cho and Galactus managed to trick the Chaos King into entering the Continuum universe which they then sealed off forever. Hercules, despite a warning from the now normal Athena, then used his awesome godly powers to repair the damage the Chaos King had caused and restore reality to it's rightful form. The effort this feat required expended not only all of his \"God of Gods\" powers, it also spent all of his usual godly might as well, leaving him completely without superhuman powers making him, for the first time in his more than 3,000 years of life, a mortal human.</p><h3>Herc</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1637279\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1637279-1296080453.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5189873417722\" data-width=\"553\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 553px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1637279-1296080453.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1637279\"><img alt=\"De-powered, Herc relies on Olympian weapons\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1637279-1296080453.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1637279-1296080453.jpg 553w\"><noscript><img alt=\"De-powered, Herc relies on Olympian weapons\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1637279-1296080453.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1637279-1296080453.jpg 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-width=\"632\"></noscript></a><figcaption>De-powered, Herc relies on Olympian weapons</figcaption></figure><p>Despite being de-powered after defeating the Chaos King and winning the Chaos War, Hercules remained true to his character and was determined to be a what he had always been; a hero.

The Lion of Olympus is the strongest Olympian God as well as one of the strongest beings in the Marvel Universe (Earth-616). Hercules' strength is extremely far beyond the \"Superhuman: Class 100\" level and enables him to lift far, far over 100 tons with absolute ease. He has demonstrated his legendary strength many times over in the performance of several highly impressive, nigh-impossible, heroic deeds and feats of strength. These feats include: lifting and tossing Marvel's 60,000 ton version of <a href=\"/godzilla/4005-21599/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21599\">Godzilla</a>, holding Manhattan Island together using gigantic steel chains, supporting Greenwich Village over his head for an extended period of time, lifting and hurling a giant Sequoia tree, lifting and carrying a starship, drop-kicking a bulldozer, stopping cold a power-punch from the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a> in the palm of his hand and forcing the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> to submit in a wrestling match. He has also overpowered the likes of Wonder Man and Abomination. It was during ancient times (while performing his eleventh labor), however, that Hercules accomplished what is perhaps his greatest and most impressive strength-feat when he took the weight of the heavens from the Titan <a href=\"/atlas/4005-44940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44940\">Atlas</a> and held it overhead for three straight hours before tricking Atlas into resuming the burden. This is arguably one the strongest strength feats in all of comics since the weight of \"the heavens\" is considered immeasurable and incalculable. Time and again the strength of Hercules has proven to be completely beyond measure - having no known limits - and at the very least rivals that of the mighty <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> (In one fight Thor was unable to break Hercules' grip because of his superior strength). The superhuman strength of Hercules is prevalent throughout his entire body, including his lower body. His highly developed leg muscles enable him to make a standing vertical leap of at least 100 feet in Earth's gravity. Hercules has cleanly severed, at the base of the trunk, an extremely large, full-grown tree with a single kick and and has effortlessly kicked over an entire tractor-trailer fully loaded with freshly cut logs.</p><h4>Controversy over Pulling Manhattan Island</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2917731\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.712\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2917731\"><img alt=\"Hercules - towing Manhattan Island.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - towing Manhattan Island.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/85763/2917731-herc_boast1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - towing Manhattan Island.</figcaption></figure><p>An incident during the 1970s, in the series <a href=\"/marvel-team-up/4050-2576/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2576\">Marvel Team-Up,</a> created some controversy among fans of the character. In issue #28 Hercules is shown pulling the entire island of <a href=\"/manhattan/4020-57225/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57225\">Manhattan</a> back into place after it has been offset. Due to complaints both from fans and staff, the feat was later retconned out of existence. Although this feat is not inconsistent with Hercules' strength based feats, it was nonetheless argued to be logically impossible as such a feat would rupture and destroy city infrastructure among other reasons. To some degree the debate over this remains to this day but, as the company itself retconned the depiction to have not existed, this is the official standpoint. Equally, Hercules is shown in myth and elsewhere as having lifted more than this weight (even bearing the entire weight of the Earth in ancient myth).</p><h3>Superhuman Durability</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242833\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242833-45229-hercules.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.62\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242833-45229-hercules.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242833\"><img alt=\"Hercules - Withstanding multiple missile strikes uninjured\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242833-45229-hercules.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242833-45229-hercules.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - Withstanding multiple missile strikes uninjured\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242833-45229-hercules.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/242833-45229-hercules.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - Withstanding multiple missile strikes uninjured</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules is super-humanly durable/practically invulnerable making him extremely resistant to nearly all forms of blunt force, penetration and energy assaults. His extremely high level of durability/invulnerability is a product of being born a demigod son of Zeus, being suckled by Hera as an infant and finally, upon his mortal death, being made a full-fledged immortal god by his father Zeus. Due to these factors he has greater resistance to physical injury/harm than any other Olympian god except his father Zeus, and possibly his uncles Neptune and Pluto. Hercules is able to withstand the impact of high caliber machine gun shells, direct hits from S.H.I.E.L.D anti-aircraft missiles, falls from incredible heights, exposure to extreme temperatures and the vacuum of space without sustaining injury or being harmed in any way. Hercules has withstood powerful cosmic energy blasts from <a href=\"/frankie-raye/4005-11605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11605\">Nova (Frankie Raye)</a>, a Herald of Galactus, without sustaining injury, and was able to survive two blank-point blasts from the man-god <a href=\"/korvac/4005-14467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14467\">Michael Korvac</a>.</p><p>Hercules has fought many of the strongest heroes and villains in the Marvel Universe, withstanding repeated punches from the Hulk (while highly enraged) and numerous blows from Thor's enchanted hammer; Mjolnir with no significant effects.

Because of the many heroic deeds he performed while a demigod, and Zeus' further need of a champion to defend and protect both gods and mankind, Hercules earned full-godhood and true immortality upon his death. As an Olympian god, Hercules is immortal and although he can be wounded or injured, he cannot die by conventional means. Another power Hercules gained when becoming a god is an exceptionally rapid, superhuman healing rate, which allows him to recover very quickly any time he actually is wounded or injured. Hercules is immune to all conventional/mortal diseases and maladies. Due to his godhood/immortality and durability, Hercules is almost impossible to kill. Only an assault that incinerated him or dispersed a major portion of his bodily molecules could conceivably kill Hercules. but even then Zeus or another god of comparable power might still be able to resurrect him. As a true Olympian immortal Hercules doesn't age and remains perpetually at the peak of his physical youth, strength and power despite the fact he is well over 3,000 years old.</p><h3>Superhuman Stamina</h3><p>As an Olympian god all of Hercules' physical abilities are superhuman, though in his case they are enhanced to a greater extent than nearly all other Olympians. This includes his endurance. Hercules' body produces no fatigue poisons, granting him practically endless superhuman stamina and making him virtually tireless. He was able to hold the weight of the heavens upon his shoulders for three straight hours without tiring. Hercules does not fatigue after any exertion, no matter how strenuous or it's length of duration. In addition to these powers, Hercules also possesses superhuman agility (agility greater than that of any professional or Olympic athlete; greater than what is humanly possible), superhuman reflexes and a measure of superhuman speed and quickness.</p><h3>Demigod Power Levels</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2399121\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2399121-hercules___youthful_demigod_panel_color_med.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.8633540372671\" data-width=\"322\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 322px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:186.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2399121-hercules___youthful_demigod_panel_color_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2399121\"><img alt=\"Hercules - Youthful Demigod\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-width=\"322\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2399121-hercules___youthful_demigod_panel_color_med.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2399121-hercules___youthful_demigod_panel_color_med.jpg 322w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - Youthful Demigod\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2399121-hercules___youthful_demigod_panel_color_med.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2399121-hercules___youthful_demigod_panel_color_med.jpg 322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-width=\"322\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - Youthful Demigod</figcaption></figure><p>During his time as a mortal demigod in ancient times and at a much later point, in modern times, when his godhood was stripped by Zeus, Hercules possessed nearly all of the powers he had as a god, but only had them at a greatly reduced level. His durability and stamina suffered the greatest reductions. Strikes and blows he would normally laugh off as full-god could now cause severe injury. Though much tougher than any mere mortal, demigod Hercules also lacked the high-level godly healing factor that would later allow him to very quickly recover from almost any injury. As a demigod, climate conditions such as extremes of cold and heat also had some affect on him, requiring him to adapt to his environment and to adjust his wardrobe accordingly. As a god Hercules has virtually inexhaustible stamina but as a demigod he can eventually become tired and fatigued which requires him to rest. Strangely, Hercules has shown a wide variation of his strength level during his times as a god, a demigod and when completely stripped of his godhood. As a demigod, Hercules has at times he seemed as strong as ever, his limitless strength apparently being his birthright, while at other times his strength has appeared reduced similarly to his stamina and durability. The most drastic example of his lower level of strength as a demigod was perhaps the time he battled the Hulk in the wake of <a href=\"/onslaught/4005-13352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13352\">Onslaught</a> having seemingly killed most of Earth's heroes, including the Avengers. Normally, as a full-god, Hercules can fight evenly and indefinitely with even an extremely enraged Hulk, but in this instance, as a demigod, when Hercules battled an enraged Hulk, the Hulk nearly beat him to death despite Hercules using his legendary fighting skills in an attempt to even the odds. Whatever the variations of his strength and power levels between being a demigod and a god, Hercules' physical powers, coupled with his fighting skills, were still great enough to enable him to defeat his half-brother, and full-god, Ares as a demigod during this same period of demigod-hood power reduction.</p><p>Hercules' physical abilities as a demigod are much higher than when he has been stripped of all godly status and become a non-powered mortal. As such, Hercules' non-powered levels of physical ability should not be misconstrued as or confused with his power levels as a demigod.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><h4>Fighting Skills</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1758162\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1758162-herc02.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4343065693431\" data-width=\"548\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 548px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1758162-herc02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1758162\"><img alt=\"Hercules - Demonstrating archery skills\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1758162-herc02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1758162-herc02.jpg 548w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - Demonstrating archery skills\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1758162-herc02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35127/1758162-herc02.jpg 548w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" data-width=\"669\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - Demonstrating archery skills</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules is Olympus' greatest warrior and champion. When he was still a demigod in ancient Greece, Hercules co-invented, along with Theseus, the first all-encompassing fighting system in human history: Pankration. Pankration is quite similar to mixed martial arts of modern times, as both combine several separate hand-to-hand combat techniques, though the methods used in Pankration were much more brutal and even deadly than modern techniques. As the co-inventor and a centuries-long practitioner of Pankration, Hercules is an expert in many styles of hand-to-hand combat. These include; boxing, wrestling, joint locks, submission holds and the combining of and transitioning between these varied techniques. He has practiced, honed and perfected his fighting skills for over three millennia, thoroughly mastering them. Thor himself has admitted Hercules is his better in hand-to-hand combat. Hercules is also highly skilled in athletics such as the discus, the javelin and the hammer throw.</p><p>Hercules is a master archer; his godly attributes combined with centuries of training have made him superior to nearly any Earth-born archer. His archery skills are even said to surpass master bowmen such as Hawkeye and Trickshot. Hercules is highly skilled in the arts of boxing and Greco-Roman wrestling (even causing the Thing to submit). Also, Hercules is a very accomplished melee fighter. He has had centuries of training, practice and experience with many types of weapons including but not limited to battle axes and long swords.</p><h4>Personality</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1589154\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.77692307692308\" data-width=\"1300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1589154\"><img alt=\"Hercules - Drinking &amp; charming the ladies\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg 1300w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - Drinking &amp; charming the ladies\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg 1300w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/1589154-hercules___on_the_make.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - Drinking &amp; charming the ladies</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules has a very confident and gregarious personality. He believes life is a gift that should always be appreciated by being lived to the fullest every day. This lust for life of his is possibly accentuated and enhanced by his mortal roots and the fact that he has experienced death. Once he has deemed someone suitably noble, Hercules is quick to assume the role of friend, confidant, drinking buddy and/or mentor - often whether the recipient likes it or not. As he has demonstrated countless times in his rather lengthy lifetime, Hercules is also a prolific ladies man and is quite adept at using his looks, charm and reputation to woo women. Additionally, he is equally adept at starting brawls with those he deems worthy of or sturdy enough to receive the greatest thing he believes one man can give another: \"The Gift of Battle!\" It's his philosophy that men must battle to truly know one and other. Perhaps this explains why Hercules is always ready to brawl/fight either friend or foe at a moments notice. When announcing his intent to bestow \"The Gift of Battle,\" Hercules often abbreviates, calling it simply \"The Gift\", especially when using it as part of one of his battle cries, i.e.; \"Prepare to receive the Gift!\" Hercules' other commonly used battle cry is \"Have at Thee!\" Despite his penchant for revelry Hercules has demonstrated a somber, brooding side at times when he has lost people whom he cares deeply for. During some of these times of mourning, Hercules has been known to overindulge in the drinking of alcohol. In reaction to the treachery of Nessus, which lead to his mortal demise, Hercules forswore the practice and use of archery.</p><p>Hercules has a strong sense of duty and honor which compels him to stand up for what he believes is right and just no matter what others consider acceptable, no matter what the consequences may be. The courage of Hercules is the equal of his strength; boundless. When a cause is righteous and just, he has always and will always face any danger, fight any foe and battle all evil despite impossible odds or personal risk. He has demonstrated his immense courage in the face of all danger ranging from multiversal extinction-level threats right down to street-level thugs. He's faced these threats no matter what his levels of power, ranging from his normal/classic godly power to beyond Sky-father levels and even when completely de-powered. Hercules has also shown a high level of pride, some would say bordering on arrogance, which has lead to Zeus de-powering him a couple of times to teach him humility. Another quirk of his personality is, probably due to coming from the cultures of both ancient Greece and Olympus (where clothing is optional), Hercules has very little modesty. He often wears a traditional Greek toga, but does not mind, and at times even enjoys, going around nude, despite modern attitudes concerning modesty and nudity.</p><h2>Physical Statistics</h2><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6' 5\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 325 lbs</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Dark Brown</li></ul><h2>Weapons and Armor</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-78118\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/78118-42714-hercules.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.495\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/78118-42714-hercules.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-78118\"><img alt=\"Hercules wearing the skin of the Nemean Lion.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/78118-42714-hercules.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/78118-42714-hercules.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules wearing the skin of the Nemean Lion.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/78118-42714-hercules.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/78118-42714-hercules.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules wearing the skin of the Nemean Lion.</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules possesses a Golden Mace forged by <a href=\"/hephaestus/4005-13905/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13905\">Hephaestus</a> out of Adamantine, the legendary indestructible Olympian substance/metal after which Adamantium was named.

This son grows up to be nearly the physical equal of Hercules. His name is <a href=\"/arimathes/4005-44455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44455\">Arimathes</a>. After years of manipulation by his bitter mother, Arimathes becomes the ruler of an entire galaxy; a harsh and ruthless dictator. The young emperor harbors hatred and contempt for the father he never knew. Hatred and contempt for Hercules. Eventually the paths of Hercules and his young emperor son cross and the two decide to settle their issues man-to-man in unarmed combat. When the battle is over and the truth of Layanna Sweetwater's is revealed, Hercules and Arimathes put aside their differences deciding to make up for lost time by getting to know each other. Arimathes eventually goes on to father three children of his own, Hercules' three grandchildren, - <a href=\"/antonitus/4005-35543/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35543\">Antonitus</a>, <a href=\"/ursus/4005-35546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35546\">Ursus</a> and <a href=\"/juno/4005-35541/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35541\">Juno</a>. Due to their Olympian heritage, each of these grandchildren of Hercules inherit a specific godlike super-power. In this timeline Hercules is the savior of the planet/world called Wilamean and as such he commands much adoration and respect for having saved them from Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds. Unfortunately, again a time came when Hercules had to save them, and this time the entire Andromeda Galaxy, too, by sacrificing his own life. The danger was presented when Galactus became part of a massive black hole which threatened the entire galaxy. To save the galaxy, Wilamean and his own family, Hercules, true heroic fashion, flew into the black hole and detonated a white hole bomb which had the effect of reversing the black hole and restoring Galactus. Though Hercules ceased to exist in his typical form, in the process of freeing Galactus from the black hole, Hercules' essence combined with that of Galactus causing the creation of an new, separate being that would be known as the Bringer of Worlds: <a href=\"/cosmos/4005-82420/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82420\">Cosmos</a>.</p><p> </p><h2><b>Other Media</b></h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>The Marvel Super Heroes</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027126\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027126-hercules___animated_thor_episode_59_02_marvel_super_heroes_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027126-hercules___animated_thor_episode_59_02_marvel_super_heroes_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027126\"><img alt=\"Hercules - The animated version from 1960's Thor cartoon.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027126-hercules___animated_thor_episode_59_02_marvel_super_heroes_color_lrg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027126-hercules___animated_thor_episode_59_02_marvel_super_heroes_color_lrg.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hercules - The animated version from 1960's Thor cartoon.\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027126-hercules___animated_thor_episode_59_02_marvel_super_heroes_color_lrg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027126-hercules___animated_thor_episode_59_02_marvel_super_heroes_color_lrg.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hercules - The animated version from 1960's Thor cartoon.</figcaption></figure><p>Hercules is introduced and used as the main foil for Thor in a <i>Mighty Thor</i> segment of the animated television series <em>\"The Marvel Super Heroes\"</em> which was produced and released in the late 1960's.

  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Jacob Conover saved the life of crime lord, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6601\" href=\"/don-fortunato/4005-6601/\" slug=\"don-fortunato\">Don Fortunato</a> from a hit put out on his life by Wilson Fisk, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\" href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" slug=\"kingpin\">Kingpin</a>. Don Fortunato promised Conover he'd return the favor if he ever needed it and fled for his life. This caused Conover to stay away from crime articles for the Daily Bugle. Among his most famous journalistic work is \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\".</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Rose III</h3><p>Upon hitting financial troubles, Conover decided to collect his favor from <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6601\" href=\"/don-fortunato/4005-6601/\" slug=\"don-fortunato\">Don Fortunato</a>, who in turn set him up as the the third criminal to call himself the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-58537\" href=\"/rose/4005-58537/\" slug=\"rose\">Rose</a>. Don gave him the mask of the Rose and he became part of the Fortunato family. Conover hired <a href=\"../../delilah/29-9856/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Delilah</a> as his muscle. <a href=\"../../scrier/65-7115/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scriers</a> became curious about the Rose's resurfacing, believing him to actually be Richard Fisk. Scriers offered an alliance with the Rose, but was rejected. When <a href=\"../../black-tarantula/29-8669/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Tarantula</a> attempted to do business on American soil, Rose opposed him. He sent Black Tarantula a message with <a href=\"../../el-uno/29-15659/\" rel=\"nofollow\">El Uno</a>'s head. The Rose re-powered <a href=\"../../electro/29-3228/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electro</a> to be his henchman against Black Tarantula, but Electro was too unstable for anyone to handle. After a few run-ins with Spider-Man, Electro disappeared. The Rose then made arrangements to resurrect <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Octopus</a>. Spider-Man tried to stop this, but was captured and made into a sacrifice for Otto's resurrection. Despite this, Spider-Man escapes leaving <a href=\"../../stunner/29-11116/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stunner</a> to take his place as the Rose's sacrifice. But before the sacrifice could take place, <a href=\"../../carolyn-trainer/29-15649/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carolyn Trainer</a> ordered Stunner to return to her real body. Just as the energy transfer took place, True Believer ninjas were positioned to die instead of her. After his resurrection, Doctor Octopus escapes the Rose. Black Tarantula arrives once again in New York. He warns the Rose of his power, making it clear that he is not one to be messed with. In response to this, The Rose visited upon Don Fortunato to ask for his help to defeat Black Tarantula. However at the meeting, Black Tarantula appeared and made a deal with Don Fortunato. Don offered Tarantula a piece of Rose's operation, Rose in a very bitter and emasculated state. He confronts the Don about this, but in retaliation Fortunato unmasked the Rose revealing him to be Jacob Conover. Spider-Man then arrives, engaging in a battle with Black Tarantula. Conover loses his temper and tries to kill Black Tarantula, but Spider-Man webbs him up, leaving him for the police. Conover is arrested and sent to prison.</p>",

  "description": "<p>Jheese (Jeice in the dub) is an extremely flamboyant and showy, often portrayed as the rookie of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\" href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\">Ginyu Force</a>, white-haired alien who appears human apart from his red skin. His precise strength is difficult to determine, although he is clearly at least as powerful as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45718\" href=\"/burter/4005-45718/\">Butta</a>, who he often partners up with for combination attacks. Due to his red skin, Jheese boasts the nickname Red Magma.</p><p>Like Butta, he lost the initial Janken contest with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40736\" href=\"/recoome/4005-40736/\">Reacoom</a> and didn't get to fight either <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\" href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\">Gohan</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\" href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\">Kuririn</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\" href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\">Vegeta</a>, although after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40732\" href=\"/guldo/4005-40732/\">Gurd's</a> death, he and Butta play to see who will get to take on the two Earthlings and finish what Gurd started. After Reacoom defeats Vegeta, Jheese and Butta allow him to have fun with Gohan and Kuririn as well, as by this point they are clearly bored and want to leave. After Goku arrives and defeats Reacoom with one blow and revives Gohan, Kuririn and Vegeta using <a data-ref-id=\"4055-52211\" href=\"/senzu-beans/4055-52211/\">senzu beans</a>, Jheese is not impressed with Goku's 5,000 power reading according to their <a data-ref-id=\"4055-45987\" href=\"/scouter/4055-45987/\">scouters</a>, and convinces himself that Goku just got lucky combined with Reacoom letting his guard down. He and Butta jump in to kill Goku, but the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47197\" href=\"/saiyans/4060-47197/\">Saiyan</a> proves more powerful than they had anticipated.</p><p>For all his boasting, Jheese is actually quite cowardly when faced with a strong threat such as Goku. Left alone when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\" href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\">Goku</a> defeats Butta as well, he leaves his friends behind and flees back to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\" href=\"/frieza/4005-40737/\">Freeza's</a> ship and informs <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40734\" href=\"/captain-ginyu/4005-40734/\">Captain Ginyu</a> of the team's decimation. It is implied that Ginyu is angry at Jheese for running away, and he treats him harshly from this point onward. All throughout Ginyu's battle with Goku, Jheese remains on the sidelines as a spectator, apart from one instance when, unbidden, he steps in and tries to help the Captain. This results in Ginyu almost killing him and warning him never to interfere again. For the rest of his screentime, Jheese just sort of tags along with Ginyu (by this point in Goku's body), and ultimately runs in to Vegeta who toys with him before brutally destroying him.</p><p>In an extra bit of storyline exclusive to the anime, he and the rest of the deceased Ginyu Force (minus Captain Ginyu himself) travel to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\" href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\">North Kai\u014d</a>'s planet and square off against the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\" href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\">Z-Fighters</a> who were training there. Jheese teams up with Butta again, though both are blasted into hell by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\" href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\">Tenshinhan</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>As a member of the Ginyu Force, Jeice is one of the most powerful members in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58261\" href=\"/planet-trade-organization/4060-58261/\">Planet Trade Organization</a>. He is surpassed only by Freeza, Captain Ginyu, Cooler, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45782\" href=\"/king-cold/4005-45782/\">King Cold</a>, and is on the same level as the rest of the Ginyu Force, Coolers Armored Squadron, and Cabo and Aka. Jeice is the most rounded member of the Ginyu Force.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Continuous Crasher Cannon - A large continuous blaster version of the Crasher Cannon.</p><p>Crasher Cannon - Jeice's crimson colored energy blast.</p><p>Crusher Ball - Jeice's signature attack, Jeice forms a large red sphere over one palm and launches it volleyball style.</p><p>Explosive Wave - Jeice can relase a body wide repusive wave from hsi body.</p><p>Flight - Jeice can fly under his own power.</p><p>Red Comet Attack - A team rush attack used with Burter.</p><p>Red Magma - Jeice's part of the combination attack with Burter to form the Purple Comet Attack.</p>",

  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>A <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55883\" href=\"/namekians/4060-55883/\">Namekian</a> came to Earth due to a violent cataclysm on his home planet <a data-ref-id=\"4020-57097\" href=\"/namek/4020-57097/\">Namek</a>. His name was long forgotten, only known as the Nameless Namek. When he came to Earth he knew he wanted to be the next Guardian of Earth, but the current guardian sensed evil inside of him. Kami had to split himself into to entities of the good and the bad. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61755\" href=\"/king-piccolo/4005-61755/\">King Piccolo</a> was the offspring of the split.</p><p>Kami became the Guardian of the Earth while King Piccolo wanted to rule it. In order to guard the Earth, Kami instinctively created his own <a data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\" href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\">Dragon Balls</a> and the eternal dragon <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56391\" href=\"/shenron/4005-56391/\">Shenron</a>. The end of King Piccolo came when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\" href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\">Goku</a> killed him, but not before King Piccolo released an egg that hatched into <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\" href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\">Piccolo Jr.</a>, who while different, was still one being with Kami.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>When the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47197\" href=\"/saiyans/4060-47197/\">Saiyans</a> came to Earth, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45986\" href=\"/raditz/4005-45986/\">Raditz</a> proved to be more than a match for both Goku and Piccolo. In order to defeat him, Goku sacrificed himself. When the stronger Saiyans <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\" href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\">Nappa</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\" href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\">Vegeta</a> arrived, Piccolo's power still proved to not be enough. When Nappa attempted to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\" href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\">Gohan</a>, Piccolo sacrificed himself. Since they were the same being, Kami departed to the Other World as well.</p><p>While in Other World, Kami gave <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\" href=\"/chao-zu/4005-19773/\">Chao-Zu</a> his body back and sent the other <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\" href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\">Z-Fighters</a> who died in the battle - <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\" href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\">Yamcha</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\" href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\">Tien</a> and Piccolo - to train with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\" href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\">King Kai</a>. When Piccolo was revived by the Namekian Dragon Balls, Kami returned to life as well.</p><p>During the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\" href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\">Cell</a> Saga, Piccolo has no other choice but to fuse with Kami to return to their original fused power level. They take Piccolo's form since it is more youthful. He returns to his full power and becomes The Namek. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\" href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\">Krillin</a> joking around tries to find a new name for him so he says things like Kamiccollo. The Namek was not amused, but to save everyone from confusion he decided that they can still call him Piccolo.</p><p>Kami leaves the position of Earth's Guardian to fellow Namekian <a data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\" href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\">Dende</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Kami as the other half of King Piccolo can be considered his equal in terms of power. Kami as the guardian of earth is in charge to keep the planet safe. As a member of the Namekian Dragon Clan he is vastly powerful with energy and mystical attacks. Kami at is introduction was shown defeating Goku quite easily and trained him for three years to be ready for Piccolo.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Explosive Wave - A burst of energy fired from the casters body to repel any attackers.</p><p>Evil Containment Wave - A magical move that allows the user to trap an opponent inside a small object like a bottle or electric rice cooker.</p><p>Eye Lasers - Kami can fire a thin yellow beam from his eyes. This can be used as a quick strike or to nullify an oncoming energy attack.</p><p>Flight - Kami can fly under his own power.</p><p>Instantaneous Movement - Kami is able to teleport to at least <a data-ref-id=\"4005-65017\" href=\"/king-yemma/4005-65017/\">King Yemma</a>'s domain without using energy or needing to sense where he is teleporting.</p><p>Magic Materialization - Kami is able to conjure objects out of thin air.</p><p>Possession - A seemingly unique ability, Kami possesed Shen to enter the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p>Regeneration - Due to his Namekian heritage Kami can regrow limbs and regenerate wounds.</p><p>Self Destruct - Kami can convert his life energy and overcharge himself to take out an opponent at the cost of his life.</p><p>Telekinesis - Kami can move objects with his mind.</p><p>Telepathy - Kami can communicate via telepathy</p>",

Freeza's body is badly damaged and he is missing limbs. He then takes Freeza to his ship to give him robotic limbs and body parts. They go to Earth to settle Freeza's score with Goku. He wanted him to blow up the planet from space but Freeza wanted to blow the planet up himself. If Freeza listened to his father they both would be alive.</p><p>After reaching Earth, King Cold and Freeza faced Trunks, son of Vegeta and Bulma. He easily defeated and chopped up Freeza. King Cold then offered Trunks a position as his new heir. As Trunks somewhat rudely declines, Cold asks if he can see Trunks' sword. Trunks accepts, and throws the sword over to Cold to inspect. Cold, claiming that the only reason Trunks defeated Freeza was because of the sword, lashes out at Trunks with the sword. Trunks proves otherwise, however, and blocks the sword, blasts Cold through the chest into the mountain, and takes the sword. Cold begs for mercy, but Trunks blasts him once more and his ship.</p><h2>Video games</h2><p>King Cold has appeared in the following games:</p><ul><li><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/996671-king_cold.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-996671\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1123595505618\" data-width=\"712\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 712px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/996671-king_cold.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-996671\"><img alt=\"King Cold\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/996671-king_cold.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38919/996671-king_cold.jpg 0w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px\" data-width=\"863\"></a><figcaption>King Cold</figcaption></figure>Dragon Ball Z Budokai</li><li>Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3</li><li>Dragon Ball Z Legacy of Goku II</li></ul>",

Master Roshi and Master Shen could not as much as lay a finger on Piccolo, and Mutaito soon steps in, but is himself outclassed and left to die by Piccolo.</p><p>Mutaito manages to survive however, after being nursed back to health by his two remaining pupils, but before he could heal his wounds, Mutaito left, in shame because he lost in front of his two students. While Master Roshi never lost faith in his master, Master Shen did, and the two parted ways, with Master Roshi escaping to the mountains while Piccolo continued to kill human after human and destroy city after city.</p><p>Several years later Mutaito, carrying an electric rice cooker in a bag, reunites with Master Roshi in the cave Master Roshi was staying in and the two track Piccolo down for the final confrontation, which by this time most of Earth's population had been slaughtered. They find Piccolo in the ruins of a city, which is hauntingly quiet, and Mutaito wastes no time launching his attack on him, this special technique is revealed to be the suicidal Evil Containment Wave technique. Piccolo is trapped in the electric rice cooker and Mutaito dies, and sometime afterward Master Roshi personally tosses the rice cooker into the deepest depths of the ocean.</p><p>Afterwards things slowly return to normal, with the cities being rebuilt and the Earth being repopulated, and over time people eventually forget King Piccolo ever existed, with the exception of Master Roshi, Master Shen and of course Kami. Some, such as <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\" href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\">Tien</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45990\" href=\"/yajirobe/4005-45990/\">Yajirobe</a>, heard the tale, but dismissed it as a mere bedtime story.</p><h2>Dragon Ball and meeting a boy with a tail</h2><p>Decades later he is released from his confinement by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61747\" href=\"/pilaf/4005-61747/\">Emperor Pilaf</a>, and King Piccolo decides to have all the current and former finalists of the World Martial Arts Tournament murdered, thereby removing all those who might be able to learn the Evil Containment Wave. To aid him in this, he spits out two eggs containing his first two sons <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19779\" href=\"/piano/4005-19779/\">Piano</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61921\" href=\"/tambourine/4005-61921/\">Tambourine</a>.</p><p>Tambourine quickly goes about the task, his first victim being <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\" href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\">Krillin</a>, and he also dispatches <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\" href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\">Goku</a> shortly after by blasting his <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56022\" href=\"/flying-nimbus-kintoun/4055-56022/\">Nimbus Cloud</a> apart and throwing him down to the ground, though he survives. King Piccolo then spits out an egg containing a third son, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61922\" href=\"/cymbal/4005-61922/\">Cymbal</a>, who he assigns the task of gathering the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\" href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\">Dragon Balls</a>. King Piccolo seeks the Dragon Balls so that he can wish to regain his youth and full power.</p><p>When King Piccolo senses that Cymbal has been killed, he orders Tambourine to hunt down the assassin. Guided by Emperor Pilaf's Dragon Radar, Tambourine arrives at Cymbal's last known location to discover Yajirobe and Goku, and in a vengeful rage for Krillin's death, Goku kills Tambourine. Again sensing that another of his sons has died, King Piccolo decides to deal with the fighter responsible personally. Upon arriving, King Piccolo confronts Goku, and despite his age he easily defeats the boy (though King Piccolo was forced to admit that Goku was an exceptional fighter for forcing him down to the ground once). Goku is left severely beaten and near death. Master Roshi then challenges King Piccolo (using the last two Dragon Balls as a lure), attempting to trap him using the Evil Containment Wave. Master Roshi is able to catch the demon king in the wave, but when he attempts to hurl him into a container, he misses at the last second. The attempt leaves Master Roshi completely drained, and he dies shortly after swearing to King Piccolo that his plans will never come to fruition.</p><p>King Piccolo is then able to gather the Dragon Balls to summon <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56391\" href=\"/shenron/4005-56391/\">Shenron</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\" href=\"/chao-zu/4005-19773/\">Chiaotzu</a> attempts to make a wish himself to prevent King Piccolo from doing so, but is killed before he can finish, allowing King Piccolo to wish for eternal youth, becoming much more powerful than before since he was returned to his physical prime. However, before Shenron can disperse, King Piccolo kills him with a single blast to prevent anyone else from using the Dragon Balls against him.</p><p>With no one left who can properly challenge him, King Piccolo decides to savor his victory, rather than all out destroy civilization like he did the first time, and instead overthrows <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82325\" href=\"/king-furry/4005-82325/\">King Furry</a> to become the ruler of the Earth. As part of entertaining himself, he institutes several evil policies such as releasing all criminals and a more planned system of destruction.</p><p>He is then confronted by Tien, who has now learned the Evil Containment Wave Technique but cannot perform it as the electric rice-cooker which would have been used to seal King Piccolo is broken (in the anime, Tien successfully performs the wave, but Drum is caught in it instead, and the rice cooker is destroyed before Tien could trap him). King Piccolo decides not to get his hands dirty, and instead spits out an egg containing <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61879\" href=\"/drum/4005-61879/\">Drum</a>, his most powerful son yet. The battle between Tien and this new son, Drum, is of course in the Namekian's favor, and King Piccolo orders Drum to finish Tien off, but a much stronger Goku arrives just in time and quickly kills Drum with a kick so hard that it knocks his eyeballs out.</p><p>King Piccolo and Goku face off again with Goku blocking every attack King Piccolo tried, and Goku manages to punch King Piccolo into Piano with his crushing weight and Goku's strength, killing his son.</p><p>A fierce battle ensues, with Piccolo briefly gaining the upper-hand a couple times when he manages to knock off Goku's <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56020\" href=\"/power-pole-nyoibo/4055-56020/\">Power Pole</a> (after which he is able to fire a weakened version of the Explosive Demon Wave), only for Goku to survive. After being unable to destroy him, King Piccolo resorts to a cowardly effort; he uses Tien as a human shield, threatening to crush his skull if Goku moves a muscle. Upon discovering that King Piccolo has killed Shenron and the Dragon Balls no longer exist, Goku resigns himself to do whatever King Piccolo wants despite Tien's pleas. King Piccolo then throws rocks at Goku with great force, costing the young hero the use of his legs and left arm. Satisfied, King Piccolo throws Tien aside and prepares to finish Goku off.</p><p>Realizing that he still had his right arm usable, Goku eventually blasts a Kamehameha from his right hand, propelling himself toward his enemy in the sky, punching a hole clean through King Piccolo's chest, mortally wounding him. Though shocked that he has been killed, King Piccolo decides that Goku has only won for now and his legacy will continue; when Goku isn't looking, he uses the last of his energy to spit an egg containing his final offspring/reincarnation. After imploring his son to avenge his death and destroy Goku, King Piccolo finally succumbs to his wounds and explodes.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>King Piccolo was at one time the strongest person on Earth. He was easily able to dominate most of the martial artists on Earth and was only stopped when Master Roshi's master sacraficed his life to seal King Piccolo inside an electric Rice Cooker. Being the original other half of Kami, King Piccolo has his power level and abilities though he uses them more viciously. After having his youth restored King Piccolo was stated to be at 260 for a power level.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Explosive Demon Wave - A very powerful blast that is fired from one hand while the second is gripped around the wrist to support the blast. This is one of King Piccolo's most powerful attacks.</p><p>Eye Lasers - King Piccolo is able to fire a quick and precise red energy laser from his eyes to nullify an enemy attack or to quickly kill a weaker enemy. King Piccolo used this to damage Goku's leg during their fight.</p><p>Great Namek - The Namekian ability to increase their size to giant proportions. King Piccolo was shown increaseing his size though not to the extent his son Piccolo or Lord Slug were able to.</p><p>Magic Materization - King Piccolo is able to conjure various objects from thin air. He is never seen doing this though is can be assumed this is how he creates his throne in multiple places and because both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\" href=\"/kami-sama/4005-19772/\">Kami</a>(his good half) and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\" href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\">Piccolo</a>(his son) can perform the technique.</p><p>Masenko - The user places their palms above their head and fires a yellow energy beam comparable to the Kamehameha wave.</p><p>Mouth Energy Wave - King Piccolo is able to fire an energy blast from his mouth as a surprise attack. This attack was powerful enough to kill <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56391\" href=\"/shenron/4005-56391/\">Shenron</a> after he granted King Piccolo's wish for youth.</p><p>Mystic Attack - The Namekian ability to extend their arms for surprise attacks.</p><p>Pokopen - A corrupted version of the Namekian ability to reproduce asexually. King Piccolo creates various Namek like monsters like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61921\" href=\"/tambourine/4005-61921/\">Tambourine</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61879\" href=\"/drum/4005-61879/\">Drum</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61922\" href=\"/cymbal/4005-61922/\">Cymbal</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-19779\" href=\"/piano/4005-19779/\">Piano</a>.</p><p>Telekinesis - King Piccolo is able to move objects with his mind.</p><p>Telepathy - King Piccolo is able to communicate via telepathy</p>",

He is noteworthy as he grows <a data-ref-id=\"4055-52211\" href=\"/senzu-beans/4055-52211/\">Senzu Beans</a> and is the keeper of the Sacred Water.His first student was a young <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\" href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\">Master Roshi</a> himself, who after climbing his tower spent three years in an effort to catch Korin, who after catching him was allowed to drink the Sacred Water.

Goku then begins his training to try and catch Korin, with Korin becoming more impressed with his increasing strength and his moral code.

  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Krillin had past training at another dojo but he was always denied respect because of his size. Krillin decided he was going to find the famous martial artist <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Master Roshi</a>. Under Master Roshi, Krillin learned discpline Respect and that martial arts was not about being cocky and always being the best or the fastest. He was taught alongside <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a>. After training with Master Roshi, Krillin was ready to compete in the <a href=\"/world-martial-arts-tournament/4015-56066/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56066\">martial arts Tournament</a>. This involved the greatest fighters from all around the world. By Krillin's surprise he got further than most would believe.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Saiyin Saga</h3><p>After <a href=\"/raditz/4005-45986/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45986\">Raditz</a> was killed, Krillin and the other <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a> learned that two more Saiyans <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a> and <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Prince Vegeta</a> would be arriving to Earth in about one year and would be even more powerful than Raditz. So Krillin and the other Z-Fighters trained intensively at Kami's Lookout for the whole year in preparation. At the end of his training, Krillin would become far more powerful than Raditz.</p><p>Once finally arriving at Earth, Krillin helped stalling time for Goku by besting 3 Saibamen in revenge for Yamcha's death, and held off Nappa in various intervals. Unfortunately, Nappa was too powerful for Krillin and the other Z-Fighters. After a wished back Goku arrived at the battlefield, Goku easily defeated Nappa and would battle Vegeta after healing Gohan and Krillin with Senzu Beans.</p><p>After a long battle, Vegeta was eventually bested by the combined efforts of Krillin, Goku, Yajirobe and Gohan. With his pride heavily embarrassed, a battered Vegeta tried to crawl to his spaceship to escape and eventually seek revenge. Despite being heavily injured himself, Krillin managed to be to only remaining Z-Fighter able to stand. As Krillin noticed Vegeta attempting to escape, he took hold of Yajirobe's sword and was ready to avenge his fallen friends.</p><p>However, just when Krillin was ready to deliver the killing blow to Vegeta, Goku telepathically told him to spare his enemy's life. Goku's reasoning was to rechallenge him for the thrill of fighting as well as possibly allowing Vegeta to turn over a new leaf. Krillin is understandably skeptical over Goku's compassion for the man who almost destroyed the planet and scoffs at the idea that Vegeta is capable of turning over a new leaf, but he ultimately and reluctantly decides to trust Goku's judgment and lets Vegeta escape.</p><h3>Namekian Saga</h3><p>Krillin, <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>,and <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma</a> went to planet Namek to find the Dragonballs, to wish the others that Nappa killed back to life. On Namek, they realized they were not the only ones looking for the balls. Also looking for them were Vegeta and <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>, a very powerful and vicious tyrant. Worried of Freeza, Krillin and Gohan teamed with Vegeta to battle Feeza's evil henchmen, the <a href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\">Ginyu Force</a>. <a href=\"/recoome/4005-40736/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40736\">Recoome</a>, of the Ginyu Force, easily defeated Krillin, Gohan,and Vegeta. Once again Goku showed up to save Krillin and the others.</p><p>While searching for the Dragonballs, <a href=\"/guru/4005-82201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82201\">Grand Elder Guru</a> unlocked Krillin's hidden powers. This was enough to keep him alive in battle with the Ginyu Force before Goku arrived. Unfortunately, Goku was unable to save Krillin from Frieza who eventually killed Krillin by blowing him to pieces telepathically. Krillin was later wished back to life with the Namekian Dragonballs.</p><h3>Cell Saga</h3><p>Krillin was given a remote to shut down the androids, but could not kill Android 18 because he had a crush on her. After Cell was killed, Android 18 turned good and Krillin eventually married her.</p><h3><b>Majin Buu Saga</b></h3><p>Krillin and the other Z-Fighters went with the <a href=\"/supreme-kai/4005-49767/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49767\">Supreme Kai</a> to battle the evil wizard <a href=\"/babidi/4005-51121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51121\">Babidi</a>. However, Krillin was turned to stone by Babidi's demon lord <a href=\"/dabura/4005-61588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61588\">Dabura</a> who utilized a spit attack. Fortunately Krillin was turned back to normal when Dabura was killed by <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Majin Buu</a>.</p><p>Eventually, Krillin was later killed by Super Buu at Kami's Lookout after being turned into chocolate and eaten offscreen. When Krillin was soon revived by the Namekian Dragonballs, he played a role in Kid Buu's defeat by lifting his hands to contribute energy for Goku's Super Spirit Bomb.</p><h3>Dragonball GT</h3><p>Krillin and Android 18 meet Android 17 while they were walking. Krillin tells Android 18 to fight Android 17's control, but is attacked by Android 17. Krillin is killed by Android 17 by a beam blast, where he was shot through the chest area. He falls to the ground and dies instantly from the attack. Android 18 attacks Android 17, but is easily defeated by Android 17 from a single beam struggle. Android 18 crawls to Krillin and knows that Krillin is dead. At the end of GT, Krillin is said goodbye to by Goku at the Kame House.</p><h3>Baby Saga</h3><p>Krillin is seen as one of the people going to Baby's new world that he created. He leaves to the planet with his family and is one of the controlled people under Baby.</p><h2>Power and Abilities</h2><p>Although small, Krillin is considerably the most powerful human on Earth, with perhaps the exception of Tien. On Namek, his power level was over 10,000 - almost as strong as Goku during his fight with Vegeta (without Kaio-Ken).</p><p><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong>: Krillin has always had superhuman strength since his appearance on Dragonball. At the end of DBZ, Krillin can easily lift about 75 tons.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Speed : </strong>Krillin can fly at about Mach 4 by the end of DBZ.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Agility</strong>: Krillin is many times more agile than a normal human. He has reflexes many times faster than a human.</p><h3>Techniques</h3><p>Destructo Disk - Krillin's signature move where he forms a thin, flat, yellow energy disk that can cut through opponents easily. It is dangerous to opponents even more powerful than Krillin as <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a> had to dodge it and he cut off <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>'s tail with the attack.</p><p>Flight - Krillin can fly under his own power</p><p>Homing Energy Wave - Used against <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> in the 23 World Martial Arts Tournament. Krillin fires two deep orange energy blasts that home in on and track a target.</p><p>Kaio-Ken Technique - A video game only power. Krillin learns this move from Goku after he has died to train Krillin as Earth's protector.</p><p>Kamehameha Wave - The signature move of the turtle school. Krillin can fire a blue energy wave from his palms after saying the name of the attack. Krillin is on such a level where, unless he holds back, a full powered Kamehameha would destroy Earth easily.</p><p>Scattering Bullet - A large yellow energy blast that splits into multiple homing attacks meant to take out a large number of enemies at once. Krillin used this against the Saibamen and killed all but one of them.</p><p>Solar Flare - Learned from <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tien</a>, Krillin is able to shine a bright light into his enemies eyes to temporarily blind them.</p><p>Spirit Bomb - During the first battle with Vegeta, Krillin had th throw the Spirit Bomb since Goku was to weak to at the time. As a video game only move Krillin learns to perform the move after Goku teaches it to him.</p><p>Tri-Form Technique - Used during the fight with Nappa, this move can be considered a less refined version of Tien's multiple form technique. Krillin can split his being into 3 seperate entities to overwhelm an opponent through sheer numbers. This attack though splits his strength and energy between the three beings.</p><h2>Alternate Reality</h2><p>In the timeline where Goku died of a heart virus and the Z-Fighters never learned of the eventual attack of the Androids, Krillin was killed during the battle. He was one of the last Z-Fighters to die and was killed via a finger energy beam by both Android 17 and Android 18. Gohan was the only survivor and he would eventually train Future Trunks.</p>",

  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>In the alternate reality of Earth-928 several years into the future; after seeing so many of his friends and comrades in the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers</a> die in their last mission, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"> Tony Stark</a> decided that he could no longer continue as Iron Man and chose to retire. But Stark also realized that the Avengers was too important and to ensure that there would always be an Iron Man to stand at the Avengers' side, devised a special failsafe. He created a special computer program based on his encephalograms and a powerful robotic shell patterned after his Iron Man Armors that he called Mainframe.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Mainframe first appeared in A-Next #1, created by <a href=\"/tom-defalco/4040-41037/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41037\"> Tom DeFalco</a> and Rob Frenz.

However he was also wary that a new danger could emerge to threaten the Earth and decided to create a contingency to prevent that from occurring.

Please see the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/buu/4005-141575/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-141575\">Good Buu</a> page for the version who was left after the evil separated (often referred to as Mr. Buu).</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Buu is a creation of the evil wizard Bibidi in his plan to kill the Supreme Kais - the guardians of the universe. Buu killed or absorbed all but one, but his great power was too much even for his creator to handle. Bibidi was forced to seal Buu in a cocoon, and without Buu, Bibidi was killed by the remaining <a href=\"/supreme-kai/4005-49767/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49767\">Supreme Kai</a>. This orb was hidden on the Earth and forgotten for many, many years.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Unbeknownst to the Supreme Kai, Bibidi had a son <a href=\"/babidi/4005-51121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51121\">Babidi</a>. Babidi was just as evil and swore revenge on the Supreme Kai as well as universal domination. Babidi discovered Buu on Earth and gathered many evil fighters to his control. He gained control of Earth fighters <a href=\"/spopovich/4005-56782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56782\">Spopovich</a> and <a href=\"/yamu/4005-57572/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57572\">Yamu</a> and sent them to retrieve energy to restore Buu to full power and release him from his prison.</p><p>Seven years after <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> killed <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a>, another <a href=\"/world-martial-arts-tournament/4015-56066/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56066\">World Martial Arts Tournament</a> was held. The <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a> entered and participated until Babidi's men attacked Gohan. Gohan was held frozen by the Supreme Kai so that the men could get his energy and leave with it. The Z-Fighters joined the Supreme Kai and followed them back to Babidi's space ship. The Z-Fighters fought through the ship until Vegeta let himself be manipulated by Babidi. <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a> and <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> battled and with each blow provided more energy for Buu's resurrection.</p><h3>Buu is Awakened</h3><p>After absorbing enough energy, Buu was finally released from his prison. Although seemingly child-like (thanks to having absorbed the Grand Supreme Kai), Buu was incredibly powerful. Buu quickly killed Babidi's right hand man, <a href=\"/dabura/4005-61588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61588\">Dabura</a>, as if he were nothing. Gohan and the Supreme Kai then battled Buu but were not powerful enough to keep up with him. After Gohan apparently died and Supreme Kai was beaten, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> appeared on the scene, having sensed Buu's great power. Even with his new power, Vegeta couldn't damage Buu. In a final move, Vegeta sacrifices himself with one final attack. But even after giving it everything he had, Buu still managed to reform from the remaining pieces left behind.</p><p>After reforming and healing Babidi, they go on a destructive spree trying to lure out <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>, <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks </a>and <a href=\"/goten/4005-40745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40745\">Goten</a>, who had interfered with Buu's fight with Vegeta. Buu would transform the entire populace of a city into candy or chocolate and eat them all before destroying the city in one massive attack.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1389441-untitledlkiuj_fat_buu_happy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1389441\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1389441-untitledlkiuj_fat_buu_happy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1389441\"><img alt=\"Majin Buu\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1389441-untitledlkiuj_fat_buu_happy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1389441-untitledlkiuj_fat_buu_happy.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1389441-untitledlkiuj_fat_buu_happy.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Majin Buu</figcaption></figure><p>Goku then arrives on the scene where he powers up to his new transformation - <a href=\"/super-saiyan/4015-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55690\">Super Saiyan 3</a>. Goku was able to evenly match Buu's power in this new form, but did not have the time to try and defeat him. Goku was stalling so Trunks could get the <a href=\"/dragon-radar/4055-56021/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56021\">Dragon Radar</a>. After Trunks had gotten the Radar, Goku told him that if Buu waited he would have someone much more powerful to play with. Buu agreed but when Babidi ordered him to keep fighting Buu killed his master.</p><p>Goku then teaches Goten and Trunks how to <a href=\"/fusion/4015-55780/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55780\">fuse</a>, but before they were ready the rushed in to use this new Fusion to fight Buu. The fusion was quickly defeated and returned for more training.</p><p>After going on an independent killing and destruction spree, Buu then uses his powers to create a house for himself. Eventualy the world champion, <a href=\"/hercule/4005-46397/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46397\">Hercule Satan</a>, finds Buu and instead of trying to kill him, he befriends him. Buu accepts this act of kindness and they become best friends. Buu heals an injured dog, but soon realizes that the grateful puppy is not afraid of him. He calls the puppy <a href=\"/bee/4005-82407/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82407\">Bee</a>. After a pair of evil men shoot Bee and then nearly kill Mr. Satan, the evil inside Buu separated from him. The two halves clash. Evil Buu wins the battle and eats the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/buu/4005-141575/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-141575\">Good Buu</a>.</p><h3>Good Separated From Evil</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412393-BuuThumbsDown.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-412393\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.022\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412393-BuuThumbsDown.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-412393\"><img alt=\"Super Buu\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22757/412393-BuuThumbsDown.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412393-BuuThumbsDown.jpg 500w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22757/412393-BuuThumbsDown.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Super Buu</figcaption></figure><p>After eating the good Buu, Evil Buu changes into <b>Super Buu</b>. Super Buu has only two things on his mind: murder and candy. Super Buu soon finds the <a href=\"/kamis-lookout/4020-52288/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-52288\">lookout</a>, as he can now sense power levels, where he confronts <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>, who agrees to take him to fight <a href=\"/gotenks/4005-51122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51122\">Gotenks</a>. Piccolo and Gotenks confront him in the <a href=\"/hyberbolic-time-chamber/4020-57773/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57773\">hyperbolic time chamber</a>, but when Piccolo sees they can't win he blows up the door locking everyone in the chamber.</p><p>Out of pure anger and hate, Buu yells and creates a rip in the time chamber which leads back to Earth, where he eats all of the remaining Z-Fighters and family members. Gotenks and Piccolo escape soon after. When Gohan comes back from training with <a href=\"/elder-kai/4005-65018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65018\">Old Kai</a>, he is able to match Super Buu's power. In an effort to regain superiority, Buu absorbs Piccolo and Gotenks. After this, Gohan is no match and Goku is forced to come and help. Goku comes back and offers to fuse with Gohan, but before they can Buu abosorbs Gohan, increasing his power even more.</p><p>Goku then finds that Vegeta has returned from the dead and convinces him to fuse with him, forming <a href=\"/vegetto/4005-45788/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45788\">Vegito</a>. Vegito fights Super Buu and ends up being turned into chocolate (as he planned), but the fusion is broken once he is inside Buu. Goku and Vegeta travel to Buu's head and release all the pods containing the Z-Fighters along with the good Majin Buu.</p><h3>True Form - Kid Buu</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1392444\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1392444\"><img alt=\"Kid Buu\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg 576w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kid Buu\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg 576w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1392444-untitledkjhh.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kid Buu</figcaption></figure><p>Exploding in anger Buu returns to his original from, Kid Buu. Without the presence of the Grand Supreme Kai, Buu reverted to his original form - pure evil.</p><p>When Goku and Vegeta broke out they saw Buu's true from. Buu then started to form an attack to destroy the Earth. Unable to stop the attack, Goku was going to use his instant transmission to get everyone he could off the planet. Unable to grab everyone, he was only able to take Vegeta, Hercule, and <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\">Dende</a> with him. Buu's attack destroyed the planet, and he then started going from planet to planet searching for Goku. He finally arrived in Other World where he was about to destroy it until Goku and Vegeta powered up so that he would sense them. Buu flies to Supreme Kai's planet where he battles Goku.</p><p>During the middle of this fight, Kid Buu spit out something that looked like a piece of bubble gum, it turns out it was Fat Buu. Vegeta and Fat Buu take turns in trying to defeat the mighty Kid Buu. Unable to defeat Buu, Vegeta takes over the battle while Goku attempts to form a Spirit Bomb. While they were doing that <a href=\"/dende/4005-51164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51164\">Dende</a> and Supreme Kai, travel to Namek where they use the <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragonballs</a> to wish everyone who was killed by Buu back to life. Goku then uses the energy of both Earth and Namek to form the Ultimate Spirit Bomb. Powering up to SSJ, Goku throws the Spirit Bomb and finally destroys Kid Buu down to the last molecule.</p><h3>Reincarnation</h3><p>Buu is reincarnated because <a href=\"/king-yemma/4005-65017/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65017\">King Yemma</a> owed Goku a favor. Buu is reborn as a young child named <a href=\"/uub/4005-58243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58243\">Uub</a> from a small poor vilage. Uub enters the World Martial Arts Tournament. In this tournament Goku asks the original Majin Buu (who is now calling himself Mr. Buu) to make sure that he fights Uub. When the fight begins Uub is frightened. It is not until Goku starts making fun of his family that Uub starts to unleash his real power. Goku flies in to the air and realizes that Uub doesn't know how to fly yet. Goku offers to train Uub at Kami's Look Out. They train there for ten years.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h4>Super Buu:</h4><ul><li>Human Extinction Attack</li><li>Cannonball Attack</li><li>Destroy Everything!</li><li>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</li><li>Super Kamehameha</li><li>Candy Beam</li><li>Vice Shout</li><li>Revenge Bomber</li><li>Gack!</li><li>Now it's my turn!</li><li>Regeneration</li><li>Galactic Donut</li><li>Absorption</li><li>Super Kamikaze Kamehameha</li><li>Body Manipulation</li><li>Matter Manipulation</li></ul><p> </p><h4>Kid Buu</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404905\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56603773584906\" data-width=\"636\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 636px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404905\"><img alt=\"Kid Buu destroys the Earth\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png 636w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kid Buu destroys the Earth\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png 636w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37889/1404905-kid_buu_destroys_the_earth.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kid Buu destroys the Earth</figcaption></figure><ul><li><i>Ki</i> Blast</li><li>Absorption</li><li>Matter Manipulation</li><li>Body Manipulation and Regeneration</li><li>Planet Burst</li><li>Super Kamehameha</li><li>Chocolate Beam</li><li>Buu Rocket</li><li>Buu Ball</li><li>Healing</li><li>Nightmare Impact</li><li>Shocking Ball</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Majin Buu appears in most DB games.

  "deck": "The famous Master Roshi was sought out by a young Goku, and after some... Persuading... He agreed to teach the boy.",
  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Master Roshi was the world's greatest martial artist until he trained the world's greatest hero <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a>. Master Roshi is a turtle hermit who lives on Small island in the middle of the Ocean called Kame island. Master Roshi met Son Goku and <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma</a> after he returned Turtle back to Kame island. As a gift Roshi gave Goku a flying nimbus. Later on Master Roshi decided to train Goku as his student after seeing his great potential by attempting Master Roshis Kamehameha wave. Roshi later decided to take another student in under his tutelage named <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Krillin</a>. For the next 3 years Roshi trained Goku and Krillin for the world martial arts tournament. Goku eventually left for a year to train on his own.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Master Roshi is the head and founder of the Turtle School and at one point the Worlds most powerful man. Roshi has developed a great number of martial and energy attacks making him very versital in battle, though his age can hamper him in battle with more youthful opponents. Roshi is shown to be an insightful and wise, if perverted, master. Roshi, disguised as Jackie Chun, was able to defeat both his students and become the World Champion at an advanced age. While later eclipsed by his students and retiring from active fighting by the end of Dragonball, Roshi remains a powerful master and way ahead of any normal human in terms of skill and power. In Dragonball Super it seems Master Roshi has been keeping up with his training in secret as he has caught up with his former students. While mind controlled and not holding back Roshi defeated Tien Shinhan and matched up to a base form Goku and even got Goku excited at the prospect of an actual fight with his former master.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Bound Technique - A technique where Roshi binds the arms and feet of his opponent.</p><p>Drunken Fist - Roshi begins to act drunk and stumbles across the battlefield utilizing odd movements to attack unprepared opponents.</p><p>Hypnosis Technique - Utilizing a number of hand movements Roshi can hypnotize opponents into sleep or into taking actions he would like.</p><p>Jan Ken Fist - One of the Turtle Schools early attacks. The user calls out the name and then adds either rock, scissor, or paper are corresponds with either a punch(rock), eye stab(scissor), or slap(paper).</p><p>Kamehameha Wave - The signature technique of the Turtle School that Roshi invented himself. Roshi has shown enough power to blow up to blow up Fire Mountain.</p><p>Pressure Point Attack - Roshi is able to use pressure points to paralyze his opponents.</p><p>Telepathy - Roshi is able to communicate via telepathy and read the minds of his opponents.</p><p>Thunder Shock Surprise - Roshi's most deadly move where he releases a large electric shock from hsi palms and entraps an opponent who can not escape. This move is very deadly and Roshi prefers not to use it.</p><h4>Forms</h4><p>50% Max Power form - Roshi's normally old form gains muscle mass on par with a trained martial artist. Roshi used this form to fight Tien during the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p>100% Max Power Form - Roshi gains a large amount of muscle mass, looking like a hulking monster on par with Broly. This is Roshi's max power. He loses his speed and agility though gains strength.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h4>Video Games</h4><p>Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure - Master Roshi as Jackie Chun appears as a boss during the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament. He is then a playable character during free play mode.</p><p>Dragon Ball: Online - When <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> publishes his book explaining the science behind ki, both the Turtle School and Crane Schools become popular once again.

His ship, The Oracle, was stuck in ice floes so McKenzie used explosive charges to break them up. Unknown to McKenzie, the ancient city of <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> was directly below. The city was severely damaged and the Atlantean ruler, <a href=\"/tha-korr/4005-40137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40137\">Emperor Tha-Korr</a>, commanded his daughter to send warriors to investigate the source of the deadly blasts. Not wanting to endanger anyone else, <a href=\"/princess-fen/4005-32130/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32130\">Princess Fen</a> made the journey alone. On reaching the ship, Fen was immediately captured by one of the crew but not speaking each other\u2019s languages, she was unable to communicate with anyone. Nonetheless having remained on board for a number of days, Princess Fen and Captain McKenzie fell in love and were married by the ship\u2019s Chaplain. Weeks later Tha-korr sent a war party in search of his missing daughter. Thinking they held Fen captive, the <a href=\"/atlanteans/4060-13407/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13407\">Atlanteans</a> attacked and killed all the humans on the ship including Leonard McKenzie. Fen was brought back to Atlantis and from that tragic marriage was born the first hybrid between a human and an Atlantean- Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner.</p><blockquote><p>\"<i><b>Namor was I born, \u201cAvenging Son\u201d. Spawn of two worlds\u2026 yet fated to belong fully to none.\"</b> \u2013 Namor (Saga of the Sub-Mariner)</i>\"</p></blockquote><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Namor grew up with hatred for the surface world. He met <a href=\"/jim-hammond/4005-12605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12605\">Jim Hammond</a>, the original Human Torch when he finally visited the surface world. But when Nazis attacked Atlantis, he joined <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> against them. Namor was also allied with his cousin <a href=\"/namora/4005-2177/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2177\">Namora</a> who was also half human half Atlantean and shared many of the same powers. One fateful day after the war, a series of earthquakes rocked Atlantis, nearly destroying it. Thus destined to repeat his mother\u2019s feat, Namor is ordered by his grandfather Emperor Tha-Korr to investigate. Namor tracked down the source of the attack to a cave in Antarctica where he found a man called <a href=\"/destiny/4005-43467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43467\">Destiny</a> who told him he is the one who attacked Atlantis with his Helmet of Power. Destiny used his mental powers to hold the Sub-Mariner still and show him Atlantis crumbling and his mother and grandfather crushed to death beneath the debris. Destiny then used his mental powers to give Namor amnesia and send him away to <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>, where he wandered around as a hobo for a number of years. During this absence, Namora was thought to have been killed.</p><p>Eventually <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a> of <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">The Fantastic Four</a> found Namor in a homeless shelter and recognising him, dropped him in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a> harbour deciding water may cure the Atlanteans amnesia. Namor instantly recovered most of his memory and returned to where Atlantis had stood before his absence. However finding it abandoned and in ruins, assumed humans had destroyed it and went about warring with the surface world. He awakened the giant whale like monster <a href=\"/giganto/4005-63046/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63046\">Giganto</a> and unleashed it on New York City. Namor also tried to claim the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a> as his own despite her relationship with <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mister Fantastic</a>. Namor and Giganto were both defeated by the Fantastic Four and he eventually found the new Atlantis, becoming monarch of the sub-sea empire. However Namor is constantly drawn back into surface world affairs and often finds himself battling both <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth\u2019s</a> super heroes and villains.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Namor was created by <a href=\"/bill-everett/4040-6103/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6103\">Bill Everett</a> in April 1939 for <a href=\"/lloyd-jacquet/4040-44885/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44885\">Lloyd Jacquet's</a> <a href=\"/motion-picture-funnies-weekly/4050-26656/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26656\">Motion Picture Funnies Weekly</a>, a promotional pamphlet that was given out for free at movie theaters. Six months later Everett expanded the eight page black and white story into a twelve page color story for <a href=\"/martin-goodman/4040-43801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43801\">Martin Goodman's</a> <a href=\"/marvel-comics/4050-18577/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18577\">Marvel Comics</a> #1 (October 1939). Talking about his creative process, Bill Everett explained \"I suppose I have always liked water. If anything started it, I suppose it was when I got interested in Admiral Byrd's expedition to the South Pole. I read a lot about that. The more I read, the more intrigued I became, so when the opportunity to create a character I naturally thought of water. <a href=\"/jack-london/4040-60128/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-60128\">Jack London</a>'s adventures at sea were influential too, I use to read a lot of sea stories.\" That character was Namor.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Golden Age</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1588767\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.118301314459\" data-width=\"989\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 989px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1588767\"><img alt=\"Namor: The Golden Age Sub-Mariner\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27783/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27783/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg 989w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/27783/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27783/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27783/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg 572w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" data-width=\"572\"></a><figcaption>Namor: The Golden Age Sub-Mariner</figcaption></figure><p>Namor (or the Sub-Mariner as he was then known) debuted in the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\">Golden Age of Comics</a> and was the original <a href=\"/antiheroes/4015-55830/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55830\">anti-hero</a> of comics.

They also introduced the concept that the Sub-Mariner's more outrageous Golden Age exploits were simply tales from comic books. Stan Lee made the character more formal, with the same pseudo-Shakespearean speech and mannerism he would give to <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>. He also coined the phrase \"Imperius Rex!\u201d - meaning of royal command - and depicted Namor's undersea city as being the mythical city of Atlantis. Lee\u2019s stories for Namor took a decided fantasy turn. After appearing as a protagonist in both Fantastic Four and <a href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\">The Avengers</a>, Namor slowly turned into more of an <a href=\"/antiheroes/4015-55830/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55830\">antihero</a> than an outright villain. He eventually appeared in his own on going feature stories alongside <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">The Hulk</a> in <a href=\"/tales-to-astonish/4050-2008/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2008\">Tales To Astonish</a>. The popularity of the series ultimately led to both antiheroes being given their own ongoing monthly titles and the acclaimed first issue of <a href=\"/sub-mariner/4050-2413/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2413\">Sub-Mariner</a> was released in May 1968.</p><h3>Bronze Age</h3><p>Namor's first wife, <a href=\"/dorma/4005-12601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12601\">Lady Dorma</a> was murdered and he abdicated.</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p>Namor joined the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, for a brief period the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and later the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Villain Team-Up</h3><p>Namor teamed up with another Fantastic Four enemy, <a href=\"/\">Doctor Doom</a>. Together they planned to launch the <a href=\"/\">Baxter Building</a> into the Sun and kill the team. But Namor was betrayed by Doom and once he realized this, he helped his enemies to avoid their fate. Namor's next approach to destroy the Four was to use their monetary problems against them. Amassing a fortune from the bottom of the sea, Namor offered them one million dollars to film a Fantastic Four movie with him as director. But the stages were not for actors, Namor planned various scenes that would result in the death of the members. They overcame their challenges and Namor leaves defeated, telling them to make the film anyway.</p><p>Namor however not only acted as an enemy to the Fantastic Four but also to the <a href=\"/\">Mighty Avengers</a> as well. When then teammate The <a href=\"/\">Hulk</a> abandoned the team and turned against his fellow Avengers Namor joined him in battle. Namor later accidentally freed his former ally <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> after finding him trapped in ice and then throwing him into the ocean causing it to melt leading Rogers to join the Avengers.</p><p>Namor then began the search for his people, planning to reunite with them and take his rightful place as their leader and the leader of the planet. This was stalled when the <a href=\"/\">Puppet Master</a> gained control over him, using him to get his revenge on the Fantastic Four. After luring in the Invisible Woman, who had been secretly searching for him, Namor dared the rest of the team to come to his undersea lair and battle him. With the use of strange ocean creatures he nearly succeeded. When the giant octopus Namor used to attack the Invisible Woman was thrown out of the lair it attacked the Puppet Master in his submarine. Busy with the threat, his control over Namor slipped away. Namor had no memory of the incident and began his search for his people once more.</p><p>After eventually finding his people and regaining his throne, Namor was soon overthrown by the traitorous <a href=\"/krang/4005-13401/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13401\">Warlord Krang</a>. In order to win back his thrown Namor had to undertake a perilous quest to find the fabled <a href=\"/trident-of-neptune/4055-56534/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56534\">Trident of Neptune</a> and prove himself worthy as the true ruler of Atlantis. On completing his quest and returning to Atlantis Namor thought he had been betrayed by his beloved <a href=\"/dorma/4005-12601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12601\">Lady Dorma</a> when in fact Droma was tricked by Krang to escape with him in exchange for her Prince's safety. The Sub-Mariner eventually rescued Dorma after chasing Krang to New York, on the way once again falling victim to the mind control of the Puppet Master and battling with <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>. After rescuing Dorma, Namor faced many further challenges to his rule from enemies such as his cousin <a href=\"/byrrah/4005-2179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2179\">Byrrah</a> and the barbarian <a href=\"/attuma/4005-15779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15779\">Attuma</a>, who successfully managed to enslave Atlantis while Namor was away in Antarctica battling Destiny.</p><h3>The Man Called Destiny</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2474724\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.46042553191489\" data-width=\"1175\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1175px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2474724\"><img alt=\"Paul Destine runs for President\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 1175w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Paul Destine runs for President\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 1175w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2474724-destiny.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Paul Destine runs for President</figcaption></figure><p>While trying to piece together the missing fragments of his memory, Namor would face one of his greatest foes.

One night the helmet gave off an eerie glow and its outer casing shattered to reveal the <a href=\"/serpent-crown/4055-15780/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15780\">Serpent Crown</a>. When Namor left Atlantis to help cure <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\">Tiger Shark</a>, Dorma convinces <a href=\"/ikthon/4005-29566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29566\">Ikthon</a> to show her the Helmet of Power and as they gaze at its changed form, they were hypnotised. On Namor\u2019s return he was shot by a guard who told him the new ruler of Atlantis was <a href=\"/naga/4005-29577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29577\">Naga</a>, the Serpent of Life and Death. The Sub-Mariner was captured and placed on a sacrificial altar by order of the Priestess of Naga who was none other than Dorma. Realising all his subjects were under the Serpent's spell, Namor broke free of his chains and snatched the crown from Dorma. He then left Atlantis to figure out what powers the Serpent Crown contained.</p><p>While attempting to discover the Serpent Crown\u2019s secrets, the Sub-Mariner encountered <a href=\"/karthon/4005-29564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29564\">Karthon the Quester</a> who was on a mission to reclaim the crown for his master Naga. Namor defeated Karthon who told him the crown was stolen centuries ago from Naga by a rebel group of Lemurians that came to be known as The Ancients. It was the Ancients who hid the Serpent Crown inside the Helmet of Power to stop it from falling into the wrong hands. A sudden attack by <a href=\"/captain-barracuda/4005-29567/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29567\">Captain Barracuda</a> allowed Karthon to escape with the crown and head to <a href=\"/lemuria/4020-55791/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55791\">Lemuria</a>. Namor followed and came face to face with the maniacal Naga who on receiving the Serpent Crown killed a number of his own people to show Namor his power. Namor was then forced to participate in the deadly Tournament of Doom where he had to fight to the death against a number of opponents, eventually defeating them all. After his victoy the Sub-Mariner turned to face Naga but the overlord killed Karthon\u2019s sister Llyna in a fit of madness. In vengeance Karthon slayed Naga from behind and the Lemurians chose the man who freed them from Naga\u2019s tyranny as their new leader.</p><h3>Defender</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-368526\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.9825\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-368526\"><img alt=\"The Defenders\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Defenders\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Defenders</figcaption></figure><p>Despite his long time hostility to the surface Namor was convinced into helping <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> in a battle against forces known as the <a href=\"/undying-ones/4005-27708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27708\">Undying Ones</a>. Soon the duo became a trio after being joined by the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. The trio soon became known as The <a href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\">Defenders</a>. However the team had no real alliance and often didn't even like each other but various threats kept causing them to ban together. They soon began to take on new members such as the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a>. Soon other heroes <a href=\"/nighthawk/4005-4832/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4832\">Nighthawk</a>, <a href=\"/patsy-walker/4005-3316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3316\">Hellcat</a> and <a href=\"/valkyrie/4005-6809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\">Valkyrie</a> joined and others aided but were often called \"Defenders for a day.\"</p><p>Namor worked with the team when they fought against demons from various Hells who attempted to merge them into one and even against his enemies and allies the Avengers when both teams where tricked by <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> and <a href=\"/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\">Dormammu</a>. Yet he along with the main four members would soon finally depart the team as they always intended.</p><p>Once again becoming ruler of Atlantis and the Atlanteans also fighting against those who wished to harm his city of his reign such as <a href=\"/attuma/4005-15779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15779\">Attuma</a> who for years wanted to rule Atlantis even turning <a href=\"/dorma/4005-12601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12601\">Lady Dorma</a> against him for a short time. It was around this time that <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\">Tiger Shark</a> appeared, a swimmer whose DNA was mixed with that of Namor's and a tiger shark. He would go on to trouble Namor for years to come. Namor finally married his great love and cousin <a href=\"/dorma/4005-12601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12601\">Dorma</a> or so he believed. It soon came to light that he had truly wed <a href=\"/llyra/4005-2178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2178\">Llyra</a>. Llyra was like Namor a human merman hybrid but ruled over <a href=\"/lemuria/4020-55791/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55791\">Lemuria</a> and its people. After discovering the truth, Namor searched for Dorma and discovered that Llyra had taken her to the surface. He hoped to free her from Llyra but she exposed Dorma to the surface by breaking her tank causing her death.</p><h3>Abdication</h3><p>After many years Namor was finally able to reunite himself with his father, however Llyra soon captured his father and along with Tiger Shark attempted to finish off Namor. In the end <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\">Tiger Shark</a> killed Leonard as the villains made their escape from battle. Namor at a time also caused his people to become dormant by accidentally releasing a type of nerve gas that also damaged his ability to breathe air. Using a suit made by Reed Richard he was able to continue his adventures on land and only after teaming with Doctor Doom to defeat the Red Skull did Doom revive the Atlanteans and give the Sub-Mariner his powers back. Namor would also finally meet Namorita and allowed her to be cared for by <a href=\"/betty-dean/4005-36300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36300\">Betty Prentiss</a>.

Despite this Namor once again found love in the form of <a href=\"/marrina/4005-12600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12600\">Marrina</a>. Marrina was alien member of the <a href=\"/plodex/4060-57619/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57619\">Plodex</a> species. Arriving on earth and growing into adulthood, she became part of the Canadian super hero team <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a>. Marrina was troubled with the discovery of her true savage alien form but she was able to become normal once again. She left her teammates at <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a> to be with Namor even creating the new undersea kingdom of Deluvia. The Sub-Mariner even joined his long time ally Captain America in joining the Avengers with his wife. The alliance was pivotal in freeing Marrina from the clutches of Attuma. However their happiness soon came to an end when Marrina became aware of her pregnancy and her savage form the Leviathan was released.

Attempts at resurrecting the evil god <a href=\"/set/4005-29092/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29092\">Set</a> were made using the Serpent Crown. Nearly all superheroes became involved in protecting the surface from the Atlanteans, Set and his followers. In the beginning it seemed as though the Sub-Mariner had fallen in battle. This was later revealed to be false when Namor, The Avengers, and the Fantastic Four fought against Set's forces but for a time he allowed the world to believe he had indeed been slain.</p><h3>Oracle Inc.</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36013/900385-namor_the_sub_mariner_2.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36013/900385-namor_the_sub_mariner_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36013/900385-namor_the_sub_mariner_2.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36013/900385-namor_the_sub_mariner_2.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Namor soon discovered the truth of why he would often act violent and uncontrolled.

To allow him to counteract his anger issues he was given a monitoring device. He soon went on to establish Oracle Inc. dedicated to providing safety to sea life. Namor soon suffered the loss of his wings in a battle with a filth being called Sluji.

Namor, <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier</a>, <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr Strange</a> and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> comprise the group, with <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a> invited as well, but he declined. While he agreed with T'challa's concerns about the Illuminati, Namor decided he could better safeguard Atlantean interests if he accepted Tony Stark's offer to join. But he insisted the Illuminati be a secret organization, and they would meet and exchange important information to prevent planet wide catastrophes.</p><p>Perhaps because they were both rulers, Namor's closest ally among the Illuminati was Black Bolt. When dealing with the mutant Inhuman Beyonder, Namor spoke for the Inhuman king. Otherwise, Namor was often the dissenting voice in the group, usually bluntly pointing out truths the other members wished to avoid. He was against Tony Stark's proposal to support the Super-Human Registration Act, as well as the plan to shoot the Hulk into space. Namor delivered the killing stroke to the SkrullBolt when it revealed itself to the Illuminati. He was given the orange Time Gem to hide and keep safe, after the Illuminati recovered the Infinity Gems at the insistence of Reed Richards.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>His only care in Civil War is the murder of the Atlantean Princess <a href=\"/namorita/4005-2113/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2113\">Namorita</a>, who was killed by <a href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\">Nitro</a> in the Stamford explosion while she was trying to stop him. Namor ordered the capture of Nitro, at first in battle with Wolverine because he felt guilty and promised to stop Nitro. But soon the two saw eye to eye and with the help of <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, Nitro became an \"honorary guest\" in an Atlantean prison. During the final battle of the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>, Namor helped Captain America by leading an attack with several Atlantean warriors because of his opposition to the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Super-Human Registration Act</a>.</p><h3>World War Hulk</h3><p>Prior to the events of the <a href=\"/world-war-hulk/4045-42294/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42294\">World War Hulk</a>, Namor is the only one who opposed the idea of exiling the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> for reasons that he will just come back even angrier than before. It seemed as Namor made the right choice in doing so, but his prediction came true. The Hulk did return and took revenge on the members of the Illuminati, only Namor was left alone by The Hulk because he opposed to the idea of sending him away. His cousin Namora who had since been revealed as alive and well joined the forces allied with the Hulk.</p><h3>The Initiative</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296907\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296907-187117-namor.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0671936758893\" data-width=\"253\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 253px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296907-187117-namor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296907\"><img alt=\"Venom Fails\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" data-width=\"253\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296907-187117-namor.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296907-187117-namor.jpg 253w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Venom Fails\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296907-187117-namor.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296907-187117-namor.jpg 253w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" data-width=\"253\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Venom Fails</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/sub-mariner-revolution/4050-28300/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28300\">Sub-Mariner Revolution</a> starts with a large explosion which wipes out entire city of Stamford in Kansas.

Iron Man decided to contact Namor about the attack, but Namor had no knowledge about it and told Iron Man to stay out of it and that he would find the perpetrators himself. Of course Iron Man did not agree, after much deliberation Iron Man decided to send a military force to Atlantis until the situation was resolved. But Namor needed to go to the surface to find out what happened for himself, after giving command to his trusty general Argos Namor took off on his own. He managed to break through the lines after a short struggle with Iron Man and visited the blast site himself and there he found an Atlantean artifact.</p><p>He decided he needed help and went to the X-mansion to get it. He briefly fought with Wolverine, who thought Namor was a terrorist. But they were quickly interrupted by Professor X. He helped Namor locate the splinter cells in America, 12 of which Namor had sent, and one he knew nothing of. Namor asked Professor X to pin point their location, but appalled at foreign spies on American soil, Xavier decided not to help Namor further, and sent him away. As he left the mansion two <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">sentinels</a> ambushed Namor, but he quickly disposed of them, without taking any damage.

Venom had ripped off two ankle wings, so now he had difficulty flying. He went to <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Sue Richards</a> (Invisible Woman) for help. When she came to him for the Civil War, Namor answered. Now it was time for her to do the same thing for him, yet she refused which led Namor to believe he had no more allies on the surface world. However, she did give him the Fantasticar to help him in his travel.</p><p>In the meantime the rogue splinter cell had set up a sort of bomb in a building in Seattle which caused the building depleted the air inside, suffocating the humans inside. Namor raced towards it in an attempt to stop it, and for the first time he met the rogue splinter cell. In the meantime the coup in Atlantis was in full progress. But Argos, Namor's general, had found out about it and met them in battle. Namor had already engaged in battle with the splinter cell and found out one of them was his son, <a href=\"/kamar/4005-48135/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48135\">Kamar</a>, who was out for revenge. Namor tried to explain to him that he banished him for his own safety, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. After Namor had defeated the splinter cell he took them down to Atlantis and was just in time to stop the coup there and show who was responsible, his son Kamar. He had also found out that one of the Atlanteans from the splinter cell had siphoned Nitro\u2019s power, the man who killed Namorita in the Civil War. His city had been compromised and he had enough of the involvement with the humans, he decided to evacuate the city through old tunnels running through the ground, the civilians would live amongst the humans, not in one city anymore.</p><p>And his army would go with him to a remote location. He made the preparations for the destruction of Atlantis, he would use Nitro (whom was still in his jail) to blow up the entire city like a time bomb and chain his son to the crown to die with the Nitro and the city as punishment for his betrayal. The city was evacuated and then blown up and completely destroyed only leaving some wreckage behind, the dead skeleton was still on his thrown. At first Iron Man believed this to be Namor but after further research it appeared to be his son. No other bodies were found in the destroyed city and they could only guess where they had gone to as they found the large tunnels. Atlantis was no more. But Namor and his army found refuge in <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>. Dr. Doom's country.

Their intentions were clear, to rule the world with each member having their own motives, Namor's being the world under the sea. The team consisted out of six members, Namor, <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom</a>, <a href=\"/the-hood/4005-41917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41917\">The Hood</a>, <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osbourne</a> and <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a>.

At the same time, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> put into action his plan to relocate the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> to <a href=\"/utopia/4020-56536/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56536\">Utopia</a>, an island floating in <a href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\">San Francisco</a> Bay. After turning the tables on Osborn, Namor made good on his promised alliance with the mutants and helped them set up Utopia, as well as fought alongside the X-Men against the Dark Avengers. Osborn sent a monster <a href=\"/plodex/4060-57619/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57619\">Plodex</a>, who in her humanoid state had been Namor's wife Marrina, to kill anything Atlantean.

The <a href=\"/atlantean-sect/4060-57635/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57635\">Aqueos</a>, the Atlantean sect of vampires, had taken the head of <a href=\"/dracula/4005-7206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7206\">Dracula</a> and hid it in the ocean depths. Namor discovered the whereabouts of the Aqueos, fought their leader, the <a href=\"/highlord/4005-73088/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73088\">Highlord</a>, and retrieved Dracula's head. This conflict broke the Shallow Peace that had existed between the two water breathing groups, and instigated an Aqueos attack on New Atlantis. After fending off the Aqueos, Namor consulted his <a href=\"/logomancer/4005-74601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74601\">Royal Logomancer</a> who provided him with part of a spell to end the Aqueos forever, if the Prince was willing to pay the cost. Namor, the <a href=\"/tridents/4060-57780/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57780\">Tridents</a>, and what <a href=\"/atlanteans/4060-13407/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13407\">Atlantean</a> troops he can muster return to the hidden city of the Aqueos. <a href=\"/abira/4005-73087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73087\">Abira</a> and Namor find the Tomb, where the oldest of the Aqueos rest, and the last part of the spell is hidden. Before Namor can complete the ritual, the Highlord arrived and revealed his Atlantean identity. Outside, the Atlanteans battled the Aqueos to buy their Prince time, and are aided by the arrival of the Royal Logomancer and <a href=\"/loa/4005-40672/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40672\">Loa</a>, who have discovered a way to weaken the Aqueos -- and Loa learned she could breathe underwater. After a struggle, and with Abira's help, Namor defeated the Highlord and completed the spell. Most of the Aqueos are destroyed, and Namor restores the Shallow Peace with the few that remain.</p><p>Loa's ability to breath underwater comes from a locket she inherited from her grandmother, Alice Ryan -- Betty Dean's roommate during WWII. The locket is ancient Altantean and is turning Loa into a water breather. While the Logomancer and Dr. Nemesis are investigating this, apparitions of the old Kings of Atlantis appear from the locket and drag Namor to his own hell. Doctor Doom unexpectedly shows up and transports himself, Abira, and Loa to Namor's hell. They find Namor trapped by the responsibilities of ruling, and make him angry enough to escape his self imposed prison. Doom abandons the trio at exit from hell, as the old Kings of Atlantis mount a final attack. While appearing catatonic, Abira is actually talking to an old Queen of Atlantis, who gives her the insight and power to help Namor. When Namor accepts Abira and Loa's help, they find the way out of hell. Back at New Atlantis, they are greeted by an angry Cyclops and Warlord Krang's coup attempt. Namor and Abira start a relationship.</p><p>Selach undermines Krang's challenge by killing the Royal Logomancer, forcing Krang and Namor into an alliance to save Atlantis. Abira choses to end her relationship with Namor by becoming his Royal Logomancer.</p><h3><a href=\"/regenesis/4045-56644/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56644\">Regenesis</a></h3><p>Namor is a member of Cyclops' Extinction team and was called forth to deal with the Dreaming Celestial who Mr. Sinister has taken control of. When a ceasefire was ordered, the team went to Sinister's palace where he took control of the team telepathically, save for Emma who was in diamond form. Due to a pre-programmed word, Emma set Hope free by making her transform into diamond form where Hope took off. Finding a vantage point, Hope shot Sinister through the head which freed Namor and the team,but Sinister predicted this and the team learns his copies are a giant hive mind. Namor continues to fight the Sinister species. He held Emma's arm when she released her diamond form as a tourniquet so she could telepathically assault the hive-mind. He was there with the team when they stared down the Celestials.</p><p>With a mysterious new habitat known called the Tabula Rasa appearing, Namor is deployed along with the extinction team where are split apart in pairs. Namor goes with Hope where they explore the aquatic portion of the habitat where the two are confronted by a monstrous creature. Namor and Hope fight off the creatures but Namor comes to explain that the creatures think Namor and Hope are enemies, which Namor wishes to change. Namor and Hope enter the Queen's chambers of the sea creatures where Namor appeases to the Queen establishing a friendship with their species, hoping for an alliance somewhere along in the future. He talks with Hope and tells her she is invited to Atlantis anytime she wants.</p><p>Namor has a talk with Emma while she is training about how losing her arm could have been shocking to such a beautiful woman. She leaves him but thanks him for being concerned. He was deployed with the Extinction team and helped them defeat some Peak prison escapees. They leave the Avengers to go fight Unit who has Hope. <a href=\"/unit/4005-4467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4467\">Unit</a> hits Emma Frost and Namor with a pheromone blast causing them to become intimate with each other on the battlefield.

The X-Men believe this, and the Avengers know it to be true. Captain America visits Utopia to demand that Scott Summers allow him to take Hope Summers into protective custody, as she is the one they believe the Phoenix will bond with. Cyclops is unwavering in his intolerance for the Avengers supposed superiority, and refuses. Captain America says he isn't asking for permission, and he is sent careening backwards by an optic blast from Cyclops. This begins the real fighting, as the helicarrier with the Avengers on board is uncloaked. Magneto sends Colossus hurling through the helicarrier, destroying a part of it, and sending the Avengers falling to the shore of Utopia. While Emma Frost whisks Hope away deeper into Utopia, Namor and the other X-Men join the fight against the Avengers. Namor says that he must side with the mutants not only because he is one, but also because he understands how difficult this is for Cyclops. As the leader of a people, Namor knows that Cyclops will and must do everything in his power to protect Hope and the others. During the battle on Utopia, Namor dives into the ocean and battles the Thing and Luke Cage. After their brief engagement, the Thing uses two large pieces of rubble and stone to trap Namor on the ocean floor. When Namor finally frees himself, Hope has run off and Scott has ordered the X-Men to surrender. The surrender was false, and when Magik returned to the battlefield in the guise of Doctor Strange, she teleported Namor and the rest of the X-Men away to regroup. Both the Avengers and the X-Men are struggling to find the location of Hope. The X-Men operate out of an old Hellfire Club safe house made known to them by Emma. X-Men are dispatched to different locations around the globe to search for Hope and battle the Avengers. Namor is sent to Tabula Rasa where old conflicts are renewed. After a brief scuffle, he knocks out Luke Cage and uses him to batter She-Hulk. He faces off against the Thing with what appears to be a stalemate until the Savage arrives and interrupts what he thinks is a mating ritual. By peering into the minds of Avengers, Emma determines that Hope is heading towards the moon. Magik arrives and teleports Namor there with Emma, Colossus, and Cyclops. The Secret Avengers had been battling the Phoenix Force to slow it down, but it had gotten through them. The Extinction Team battled the Avengers on the Blue Area of the moon, and after a brief conflict, the Phoenix arrived. Iron Man, using a special suit, blasted the Phoenix Force, accidentally dispersing it into five portions. Namor along with Emma, Cyclops, Magik and Colossus were each imbued with a portion of the Phoenix Force and become the <a href=\"/phoenix-five/4060-59234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59234\">Phoenix Five</a>. They left the moon with Hope, and began their work. They attempted to remake the world into a better place. They ended world hunger, outlawed war and destroyed all weapons including tanks, missiles, submarines, and sentinels(Pax Utopia), and provided near-unlimited clean energy and water for all. Regardless of all the good they did, the Avengers did not trust them. A small invasion force entered Utopia to take Hope away. Before a battle could be fought, the Scarlet Witch intervened and teleported away with the Avengers and a voluntary Hope. This act against the X-Men prompted the Phoenix Five to hunt down the Avengers.</p><p>Further battles ensue, and soon mutant teenager Laurie Tromette is taken hostage by the Avengers. Emma meets with Namor, who is disgusted at Cyclops's passive leadership, and tells him where <a href=\"/transonic/4005-72484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72484\">Transonic</a> is imprisoned. Emma tells him she is in <a href=\"/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda</a> ... and that she hasn't told Scott.</p><p>With this knowledge, Namor invades Wakanda in all his fiery Phoenix fury, declaring war. With his new powers, Namor creates giant tidal waves that swallow humans and buildings whole, drowning hundreds to thousands of Wakandans. Atlanteans invade the city and Namor assaults the Avengers. The combined forces of all the Avengers, including the Vision, the Red Hulk, and Doctor Strange cannot stop him. Namor breaks the Red Hulk's arm, exposing the bone, and swats away Thor, god of thunder. He gives them all they can handle and seems nearly unstoppable. The Avengers call out the Scarlet Witch, the only one among them who seems to be able to do any damage to the Phoenix. She unleashes a large blast of chaos energy on Namor. The blast results in both of them being rendered unconscious. The rest of the Phoenix Five show up and in Namor's defeat his portion of the Phoenix Force leaves him and is then spread amongst the remaining avatars. After his defeat Namor slips away back to Atlantis, leaving the pitiful ruins of a once great city behind him.</p><h3>New Avengers</h3><p>When Black Panther calls for the Illuminati to come to Wakanda in order to stop an attack on the planet, Namor joins the other members and heads his call, with Captain America joining them and <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> taking the place of Charles Xavier. However, Black Panther assures him that when the threat is past, he won't hesitate in killing Namor. The Illuminati decide to form the <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a> in an attempt to divert the threat of the other planet colliding with theirs, but the gauntlet gems shatter. Captain America is removed from the equation of helping the Illuminati as they deem him a hindrance. With the clock counting down on the colliding worlds, the members form their back up plans but the reveal is that each plan will have at least one sacrifice. Beast manages to convince the others that they find the infinity gems of the second world to buy themselves some more time. Namor is excited by all this and is the first to rush off into the alternate world. They land and find Galactus attempting to eat the planet and thus the Illuminati engages in battle with his herald, an alternate reality <a href=\"/terrax/4005-2106/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2106\">Terrax the Tamer</a>. The team manages to defeat Terrax and they build an anti-matter injection system meant to destroy the alternate world. The team heads to the incursion point in Latveria where the incursion is actually something much worse. A race of beings called the mapmakers come and try to harvest everything on Earth, but when the Illuminati realize they have no time left, they go to the dead Earth and destroy it.</p><p>Namor meets with T'Challa in secret from the others and offers to make peace with Wakanda. T'Challa informs him he will talk with his sister about it, but to no avail as Wakanda declares war. T'Challa meets with Namor in Necropolis and reveals to him that Namor was lied to by Shuri in her saying she was considering his offer. While Namor is with T'Challa, Wakanda makes its move and attacks Atlantis. Namor leaves and heads back to his kingdom to find it in ruins and his people slaughtered.</p><p>Namor takes part in the events of Infinity against Thanos' army. Namor and the other Illuminati go around stopping the incursion against their world.</p><p>Namor eventually decides that the Illuminati is far too weak and indecisive, and decides to speak instead with a different group of people ... a new incarnation of the Cabal, consisting of Maximus, Black Swan, Terrax, Proxima Midnight, Corvus, and Thanos. Namor leads the Cabal into battle against other worlds, and they slaughter the heroes of those worlds, and afterwards destroy it in order to save their own. At first, Namor is confident in taking such actions, but as time goes on, and the bloodthirstiness of the Cabal grows, Namor begins to question his decision. He goes to Doctor Doom to ask for help. He is refused. Doom is insulted that Namor did not turn to him first, and so asks Namor to leave. Alone and in despair, Namor leaves and is not sure what course of action is left for him to take. The other members of the Illuminati, which also at this point includes Amadeus Cho, Captain Britain and Doc Green, are being hunted down by S.H.I.E.L.D. and the S.H.I.E.L.D.-run Avengers group (which includes War Machine and his War Machine drones, Sam Wilson as Captain America, Captain Marvel, and Hawkeye). S.H.I.E.L.D.'s forces engage the remaining members of the Illuminati in open battle. A third party - the New Avengers led by Roberto Da Costa aka Sunspot - arrives with a larger aircraft than the two helicarriers combined. They order Steve Rogers and S.H.I.E.L.D. to cease their attack immediately. In response, Rogers unleashes the Bruce Banner of an alternate reality where the Avengers conquered the world. This Bruce Banner is remote controlled, and unleashed on the Illuminati while the S.H.I.E.L.D. forces battle Shang Chi's army of clones. Finally ready to reveal their final play, the Illuminati stands back as every participant in the conflict is encased in an individual force field. Susan Storm, who had been pretending to work for S.H.I.E.L.D., revealed her true allegiance. With her were Queen Medusa and King Blackbolt of the Inhumans, as well as Namor.</p><h3>All New Invaders</h3><p>Namor is kidnapped by the Kree Tanalth the Pursuer so the Supreme Intelligence can find the whereabouts of the God Whisperer, a weapon Namor, Bucky and Jim Hammond found and broke in WWII. Tanalth is sent after the other two Invaders who recruit Captain America, and with some help from the Golden Age Vision, they head to Hala to rescue Namor.</p><h3>Time Runs Out</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4334355\" data-ratio=\"0.845\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4334355\"><img alt=\"Panther's revenge\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Panther's revenge\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg 600w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4334355-0313237363-panth.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Panther's revenge</figcaption></figure><p>After coming clean to the Avengers and Illuminati about his actions with the Cabal, he pleads with the heroes to help him stop Thanos and the others before they get even more out of hand. A plan is proposed to destroy the Cabal during the next incursion by detonating the opposing world before the villains have a chance to flee. After making the preparations and preparing to return home, Namor is confronted by Black Panther and Black Bolt. Black Panther stabs Namor through the chest with a ceremonial Wakandan blade, after which Black Bolt finishes him off by using his sonic scream. Mortally wounded, Namor looks up in horror as the planet begins to explode, and lets out an outraged scream before apparently being consumed in the ensuing blast.</p><p>He and the rest of the Cabal are later revealed to have survived by taking refuge on <a href=\"/ultimate-marvel/4015-56202/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56202\">Earth-1610</a>.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Powers</h2><p>The Sub-Mariner is one of the strongest mutants in the Marvel Universe being classified as a Class 100 character. When Namor is underwater his strength has been stated to be virtually unmatched. Namor is strong enough to lift hundreds of thousands of tons and hold his own in hand to hand combat with the Hulk, Thor as well as the Blue Marvel. He has superhuman stamina, durability, agility and speed, but his powers slowly decrease as he spends time out of the water. He can survive indefinitely in water or on land, and is able to withstand all pressure and cold in the sea. He has the durability to withstand the pressure of the depths of the ocean, extreme heat temperatures, and sonic attacks. Namor also has an accelerated healing factor, which is at it's peak when immersed in water.</p><p>Although being deprived of water for long periods can make him ill and relatively weak, he once spent several years living as an amnesiac human in the Bowery region of New York after being mind wiped by Paul Destine. He can swim at speeds of over 300 knots. He also has an extended lifespan being over 90 years old, yet physically still in his prime. Namor also has the ability to channel the powers of any aquatic life in the sea. For example, channeling the power of an electric eel and shooting electric bolts from his hands. He has also used radar powers like a blind fish to see Sue Storm whilst she was invisible. He also has marine telepathy although he rarely uses it and displays this ability he can control sea life to a certain degree.</p><p>All Atlantean magic flows from Namor, their king. His royal blood also is a magic ingredient that can be used in spells.</p><h3>Mutant Power</h3><p>Namor's mutant power are the wings on his ankles which appear to allow him to fly and his greater degree of strength. Namor was actually the first comic book character with the power of flight, already flying in his second comic book appearance in <a href=\"/marvel-comics/4050-18577/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18577\">Marvel Comics #1</a>, while all other contemporary characters like Captain Marvel, Superman and Wonder Woman only could leap great distances and didn't fly canonically until several months later.</p><p>His skin is very resistant to any physical damage, he can resist bullet fire with ease and is fireproof.</p><h3>Phoenix Force</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2477390\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75550660792952\" data-width=\"454\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 454px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2477390\"><img alt=\"Staring down the Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg 454w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Staring down the Avengers\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg 454w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/7/78977/2477390-namor_epic.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Staring down the Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>When Namor gained possession of the Phoenix Force, he was granted new powers. He gained vast telepathic and telekinetic powers. He gained the ability to manipulate the Phoenix's cosmic energy for a few effects such as setting people on fire or projecting it as energy. He also acquired hydrokinesis, managing to drop a massive tidal wave on Wakanda. On top of these new powers, Namor's original stats were further enhanced. His strength increased to the point he could rip Rulk's arm off by the finger with utter ease. His durability increased substantially to where the Avenger's team couldn't seem to even slow him down despite hitting him with their best shots. Despite this upgrade, Namor did have his weaknesses. The main weakness of the Phoenix Five was the magic of the Scarlet Witch. Namor was only subdued in his fight with the Avengers due to Wanda using her chaos magic against him and when their powers clashed she was rendered unconscious meaning it took most, if not all, she had. The avatars were also shown to be weak against special Shi'ar tech, the energy properties of the Iron Fist and like all the avatars, Namor's mind was corrupted by the Phoenix Force.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Due to Namor's extended lifespan and fighting in many wars and battles, he is a seasoned hand-to-hand combatant and experienced diplomat and a fine king. These skills have earned him the respect of his colleagues, no matter which side he was on, and fear of his enemies. He is also a capable weapons user having wielded his trident, swords and spears efficiently. Namor's preferred method of combat is engaging his opponents in hand-to-hand combat.</p><h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296856\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.6625\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296856\"><img alt=\"Namor's Hero Identification Card\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Namor's Hero Identification Card\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/296856-193361-namor.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Namor's Hero Identification Card</figcaption></figure><p><b>Sex:</b> Male</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Black</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</p><p><b>Height:</b> 6'2\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 278 lbs</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Namor is the original \"hotheaded\" character in the Marvel cast of characters.

Caleb Alexander hypothesized in <a href=\"/namor-the-sub-mariner/4050-4406/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4406\">Namor, the Sub-Mariner</a> that Namor's mood swings might be due to his hybrid nature, and more specifically an oxygen imbalance in his blood, that could be remedied by spending equal time above and below the waves. However, there is evidence to suggest Alexander's theory is not completely sound, and seems to ignore the Namor's upbringing and social status in Atlantis.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p><a href=\"/trident-of-neptune/4055-56534/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56534\">Sacred Trident of Neptune</a></p><p><a href=\"/horn-of-proteus/4055-56533/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56533\">Horn of Proteus</a></p><p>Personal Flagship</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p>In most realities, Namor retains his essential traits and abilities.

Like pre-Cataclysm Atlantis, Benasylum was an island of magic and advanced sciences, and its people do not breathe water and are not blue, though they do have pointed ears. Unlike Namor, Numeor had no powers, except one. His bloodline allowed him to safely wield the <a href=\"/trident-of-neptune/4055-56534/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56534\">Trident of Poseidon</a>. Numenor could fly with aid of winged sandals.</p><p>Count Otto Von Doom, along with the Frightful Four, and the Fantastick Four, crossed the Atlantic to find Benasylum. Seeing Numenor's infatuation with Susan Storm, Doom offered an alliance against Sir Richard Reed and Captain Benjamin Grimm to win the lady for the Emperor. But the allies turned on each other and Doom attempted to wrest the Trident from Numenor, who was wounded with the weapon. This appeared to destroy the magical bonds of Benasylum, and the island sank.

Kevin Feige stated in a 2010 interview with Collider that Universal did not have any of the Marvel characters, which would mean that a Namor movie would be made by Marvel Studios.

  "deck": "Nappa is a part of the saiyan race, which are from the Planet Vegeta. He's one of the last survivors of his race and works under Prince Vegeta until he is killed by him.",
  "description": "<h2>First Appearance</h2><p>Being the general of the saiyan army he was in charge of the protection and teaching of King Vegeta's son, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Prince Vegeta</a>. Later when Prince Vegeta's power exceeded his own, Nappa became Vegeta's right hand man. Where ever Vegeta went Nappa was with him. When another saiyan, <a href=\"/raditz/4005-45986/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45986\">Raditz</a>, was killed on Earth Nappa and Vegeta went to Earth looking for the Dragonballs. It took them one year to reach Earth. When they got to Earth Nappa destroyed a city and Earth's Z-Fighters engaged them in battle. <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a>, <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tien</a>, Chiautzu,and <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> where easily killed. <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a> showed up before Nappa could kill the rest. Nappa was no match for Goku. Lying on the ground,beaten and humiliated, Nappa asked for Vegeta's help. Vegeta grabbed Nappa and threw him into the air and shot him with a blast that ended Nappa's life.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Nappa is bald and has a thick mustache. He wears the standard Saiyan armor with black armored gloves and a blue scouter.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Nappa is extremely aggressive and brutal. He is also highly confident in his power. He holds Vegeta in very high regard until Vegeta betrayed him. Nappa has a tendency to go into intense rage that he is not able to think straight and has to be told by Vegeta to concentrate in the battlefield.</p><h3>Powers and Abilities</h3><p>As a member of the Saiyan race, Nappa possesses all the powers inherent to his race. He is super-humanly strong and durable, and possesses enhanced speed and reflexes. Despite his size, Nappa has proven numerous times to outspeed all the Z Warriors, aside from Goku, during the first season of the show. He had also \u201cevolved\u201d to the point where grabbing his tail would not incapacitate him.</p><p><strong>Great Ape Transformation : </strong>As a saiyan, Nappa can transform into a great ape however he has no control over this form.</p><p><strong>Super Strength and Durabilty:</strong> Nappa can lift approx. 50 tons at the time of his appearance during the first season of Dragon Ball Z. He is immensely strong, and stronger than any of the Z Warriors at this time (until Goku finishes training with King Kai). Nappa was seen wrecking a Fighter Jet in order to \u201camuse himself,\u201d and was seen effortlessly tearing through steel. He also easily knocked away Gohan\u2019s \u2018rage enhanced\u2019 attack once Piccolo was killed during the battle with Nappa and Vegeta. It can be assumed that if he had not been defeated by Goku, and killed by Vegeta, Nappa would have become more powerful as time went on.</p><p><strong>Super Speed :</strong> Nappa can fly at about Mach 2.</p><p><strong>Energy manipulation:</strong> Nappa is an expert at ki manipulation and has come up with various ki techniques. His highest power blast is easily at continent wrecking level.</p><p> </p><h2>Overall Power</h2><p>Nappa is powerful enough to destroy an entire city with only two fingers. He was able to dominate the Z-Fighters, survive a Chiatzou's bomb and Tien's spirit tri beam without showing distress and fear. Nappa, however, was beaten by Goku but he managed to put up a fight.</p><h2>Techniques</h2><p><strong>Bomber DX </strong>- Nappa fires a white colored blast from his hand. He used this move against Piccolo.</p><p><strong>Nappa Cannon </strong>- This is Nappa's ultimate attack. Nappa powers up a lot of ki and fires a strong blast from his mouth.</p><p> </p><h2>Reappearance</h2><p>In GT, during when <a href=\"/android-17/4005-40804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40804\"> Super Android 17</a> appeared, a large hole was created between Earth and Hell (which contains all the past villains from the previous sagas. Nappa came back to earth and destroyed a city (like last time) and then Vegeta arrived to Nappa. Nappa made an attempted to attack Vegeta, but Vegeta once again blasted Nappa away like last time.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

Every year, the couple used to join five other couples in an organization called the <a href=\"/pride/4060-40890/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40890\">Pride</a>. Eventually, Nico was shocked to see her father performing a spell casting scenario in which he was one of those who murdered a girl for their ritual in their organization. Nico made a decision to help the others run from their parents. While running, Nico was shocked to see her mother wielding a staff called the <a href=\"/staff-of-one/4055-40449/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40449\">Staff of One</a>. Later, Tina Minoru revealed that she and Robert were secretly dark wizards. Attempting to jam the staff on her daughter's chest, Nico absorbed it.</p><p>Following some events, <a href=\"/dale-yorkes/4005-40928/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40928\">Dale Yorke's</a> Samurai attempted an attack against her with his battle axe, but the Staff of One just merged with her. By saying the word \"Freeze\", she was able to freeze <a href=\"/stacey-yorkes/4005-40930/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40930\">Stacey Yorkes</a>. The incidents therefore explain the fact that Nico Minoru, like her parents, is actually a witch and whenever she experiences bleeding, the Staff of One merges with her.</p><p>To be able to hide her identity as Nico Minoru, she used the name Sister Grimm but it did not last for long. She was then recruited by <a href=\"/alex-wilder/4005-2249/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2249\">Alex</a> and became the unofficial leader of the <a href=\"/runaways/4060-40440/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40440\">Runaways</a> for a while.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Nico Minoru was created by <a href=\"/brian-k-vaughan/4040-40448/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40448\">Brian K.

During this period, she becomes engaged in a relationship with fellow Runaway <a href=\"/alex-wilder/4005-2249/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2249\">Alex Wilder</a>, but this is broken when Alex ends up betraying the team to the Pride. Despite the resentment she feels at him for betraying her trust (thoughts she articulates by punching him in the face), Nico still grieves his death at the hands of the Gibborim, and wastes a resurrection spell in an effort to bring him back. When the Runaways are separated and each placed into different foster homes at the urging of <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, Nico finds herself in Father Flanagan's Home for Unwanted Goth Kids. While initially accepting her place there and trying to forget her past as a Runaway, Nico is soon drawn back into the world of super heroics when she is attacked by the villainous <a href=\"/marie-laveau/4005-21557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21557\">Marie Laveau</a>, who was seeking the Black Mirror, one of the Four Cornerstones of Creation, which Nico's parents had stolen from her. After a lengthy magical confrontation, Nico defeats the sorceress, only for Laveau to escape with the true prize within the Mirror, the last page of the <a href=\"/the-darkhold/4055-45058/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45058\">Darkhold</a>. Following this battle, Nico accepts her place as a superhero, and leaves the orphanage to return to the reunited Runaways.</p><h3>Against Past Geoffry Wilder</h3><p>When <a href=\"/gertrude-yorkes/4005-1939/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1939\">Gert's</a> future self arrives in their time to warn the Runaways about <a href=\"/victor-mancha/4005-1937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1937\">Victor Mancha</a>, she agrees with Gert that he shouldn't be killed. Nico is devastated when <a href=\"/karolina-dean/4005-1943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1943\">Karolina</a> leaves to be wed to <a href=\"/xavin/4005-1944/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1944\">Xavin</a> in order to unite their warring planets, particularly since mere moments before, Karolina had revealed her sexual identity and her unrequited love for Nico. Just when she thought her life couldn't get more complicated, a new version of the Pride appears, led by a version of <a href=\"/geoffrey-wilder/4005-40925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40925\">Geoffrey Wilder</a> summoned from the 1980's. Wilder attempts to resurrect his dead family by using <a href=\"/molly-hayes/4005-1936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1936\">Molly</a> as bait to lure Nico to be sacrificed by Gibborim. Although they are able to defeat Wilder and the new Pride with the return of Karolina and Xavin, Gert is killed while attempting to save Chase from being sacrificed instead of Nico. This event greatly distresses her and she begins a physical relationship with Victor Mancha in order to help her cope with Gert's death. During this time, Nico confesses to Victor that she often finds herself seeking out physical comfort in times of great stress and grief.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>After an upcoming threat was revealed about Victor Mancha, Nico and her co-Runaways have to abduct Victor to interrogate him about some details despite the murder of his parents. However, this becomes possible after <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron's</a> defeat. Nico then recruits Victor to the team. Following some events, the Gibborim then attempt to take Nico's soul because of its purity and its availability for the Gibborim to consume. Victor then saves her from the aforementioned villain and leads to a relationship between the two Runaways. After going back to their headquarters, Xavin realizes that she has made their location noticeable for <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> and the <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a>, so to be able to escape, Nico orders her team to relocate.</p><h3>Witchbreaker</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238350\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238350-133274-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4325\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238350-133274-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238350\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238350-133274-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238350-133274-nico-minoru.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238350-133274-nico-minoru.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238350-133274-nico-minoru.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"></noscript></a></figure><p>To be able to escape from the authorities that chase them, and to escape the anxious deal with <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>, the Runaways become stuck in 1907 <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York City</a> thanks to a faulty time-machine, and are thrust into the middle of a superhuman gang war. During this time, Nico is kidnapped and tortured by a woman known as the \" <a href=\"/witchbreaker/4005-54963/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54963\">Witchbreaker</a>\", in truth Nico's great-grandmother. The Witchbreaker teaches Nico about many things. Nico also learns a lot of improvements to her abilities that increase her potential. Despising her descendant for her supposed frailties, the Witchbreaker inflicts increasingly painful tortures upon the Runaway in order to strengthen her, and allow her to wield the <a href=\"/staff-of-one/4055-40449/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40449\">Staff of One</a> to greater effect. Eventually escaping the Witchbreaker (off-panel, and through as yet unknown means), Nico assists her team in returning to the past, breaking up amicably with Victor in the process after the latter fell deeply in love with a girl from that time period.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-329711\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/329711-54106-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4281045751634\" data-width=\"306\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 306px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/329711-54106-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-329711\"><img alt=\"Secret Invasion\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" data-width=\"306\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/329711-54106-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/329711-54106-nico-minoru.jpg 306w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Secret Invasion\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/329711-54106-nico-minoru.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5648/329711-54106-nico-minoru.jpg 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" data-width=\"306\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Secret Invasion</figcaption></figure><p>Nico Minoru, along with the other Runaways, joins forces with the <a href=\"/young-avengers/4060-40426/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40426\">Young Avengers</a>. They are the first to encounter a group of invading <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrulls</a> in New York City, who are easily defeated. The team had just arrived after visiting 1907. Xavin, who is also a Skrull, tried fooling the invading Skrulls but is misinterpreted by Nico and Victor for being a traitor, helping his race to invade. Nico and Victor attack her not knowing her real intentions. Afterwards, the issue is cleared up that Xavin's intention was only to avoid them fighting the Skrulls because of the greater abilities that they possess. Nico then leads the Runaways while joining forces with the Young Avengers. <a href=\"/wiccan/4005-40505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40505\">Wiccan</a> then asks the team to leave and promises that they will only have to call them in times of need.</p><h3>After the Invasion</h3><p>Following their exploits in the past and the <a href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\">Secret Invasion</a>, The Runaways move into one of the Pride's safehouses on the California beach. Nico displays much greater magical power, but with some unexpected results. While fighting some of the few remaining Majesdanes (Karolina's people), she casts a spell that physically \"scatters\" her opponents, but emotionally scatters her teammates. After Xavin leaves with the Majesdanes in Karolina's place, the team begins fighting a deranged megalomaniacal Radio DJ. When one of her parents' former associates grabs hold the Staff of One, a security daemon is released from the staff and eats the associate. She is continuing to learn her magicks and attempting to control them more fully.</p><h3>Avengers Arena</h3><p><a href=\"/runaways/4060-40440/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40440\">Runaways</a> Nico and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/chase-stein/4005-1938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1938\">Chase Stein</a> are amongst the 16 superpowered teenagers kidnapped by <a href=\"/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\">Arcade</a> and forced to take part in a thirty day-long deathmatch with only one survivor. Some of the teens attacked Arcade in an effort to stop the games anyone could get hurt and even though Chase was among them, Nico chose to stay back and observe. Using new powers, Arcade thoroughly defeats the teens and, to further prove his point, makes the first kill: <a href=\"/avengers-academy/4060-57354/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57354\">Avengers Academy</a> student <a href=\"/mettle/4005-69913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69913\">Mettle</a>. She and Chase then set up camp in the beach quadrant, which is also one of the camps hit by the night attacker.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2885750\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3138357705287\" data-width=\"889\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 889px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2885750\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" data-width=\"487\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg 889w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg 487w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg 889w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2885750-avengers_arena_004_008.jpg 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" data-width=\"487\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Stressed out and unable to gain any more than a few minutes sleep due to paranoia, Nico and Chase opt to try for an alliance with the remaining Avengers Academy students: <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hazmat/4005-69914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69914\">Hazmat</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/juston-seyfert/4005-41669/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41669\">Juston Seyfert</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/reptil/4005-60768/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60768\">Reptil</a>, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>. Despite some initial trust issues the two teams agree to an alliance, with the Runaways providing food, courtesy of Nico, and the Academy students providing numbers.</p><p>Unfortunately the alliance was short-lived due to Reptil being badly injured by fire one night. X-23, who was first on the scene, blamed Chase for the attack, because of his <a href=\"/fistigons/4055-55772/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55772\">Fistigons</a>. Hazmat, believing the alliance was a ploy to kill them all, opened fire on Chase, who was saved last minute by Nico's intervention. Not wanting to fight, Nico decided to leave with Chase, offering Jenny and Laura food from her enchanted tree. In vengeful act, Hazmat killed the tree and allowed the two to leave. Unsure of whether or not Chase had actually attacked Reptil, tension developed between the team mates as they returned to their former campsite. On the way their, Chase fell behind and stumbled across the <a href=\"/darkhawk-amulet/4055-56481/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56481\">Darkhawk Amulet</a>, which had formerly belonged to Chris Powel (<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/darkhawk/4005-2111/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2111\">Darkhawk</a>). He decided not to tell Nico this for fear that she would think he'd killed Chris.</p><p>When Arcade announced that he had placed a supply crate, full of food, medicine, and weapons, in the desert quadrant safe zone, Nico and Chase began the journey to it. Along the way, they ran into <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/cammi/4005-41747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41747\">Cammi</a>, whom they saved from an avalanche. The trio then formed an alliance and made for the supply crate and were the first to arrive. However, Cammi suggested that they leave it because \"Some prizes aren't worth winning.\"Instead they watched as Arcade teleported <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/braddock-academy/4060-59618/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59618\">Braddock Academy</a> students <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/nara/4005-86742/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86742\">Nara</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/anachronism/4005-86739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86739\">Anachronism</a>, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bloodstone/4005-86740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86740\">Bloodstone</a> to the crate, just in time to beat fellow Academy students <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/apex/4005-86741/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86741\">Apex</a> and <a href=\"/kid-briton/4005-86714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86714\">Kid Briton</a>, accompanied by non-Academy student <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/death-locket/4005-85857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85857\">Death Locket</a>.</p><p>After the fight between the two groups and the death of Kid Briton, Cullen approached Nico and the others and offered to split the crate if they helped to bury Brian. They agreed and the groups allied, minus Katy, who was revealed to be manipulating everyone from the first day, and Death Locket, who had gone chasing after her. Nico attempted to bond with Nara over their mutual experience of bad boyfriends, but was rebuffed.</p><p>Later on, after Laura had helped Juston turn the remnants of his sentinel into a battlesuit, Apex, now controlled by someone named Tim, and Rebecca ran into the group. Nico tried to stop Juston but was attacked. This caused Chase to turn into Darkhawk and fight him. The fight was only broken up when Tim created an E.M.P. The group, unsure of Tim's story, tied him up as he explained that he and Katy shared a body and were technopaths. He also revealed that Katy was responsible for the night attacks.</p><p>When it came to a vote over whether or not they should kill Tim to protect themselves from Katy, Nico was one of the five teens who voted to spare him, and was also the most vocal about it. When Chase decided to go against the group's decision, Nico forced him from the group with a spell, crying as she did so. Realizing they needed biological powers to watch Katy, Nico took first watch, but was knocked out by a min-controlled Death Locket. Katy escaped, killing Juston and taking both Rebecca and the sentinel as weapons.</p><p>Nico awoke the next morning and alerted Laura, who ran after Katy, and the others. Before they could form a solid plan, however, Katy attacked, dumping an unconscious and bloody Laura in their midst. Nico stepped up and distracted Katy while the others ran into the snow quadrant. Nico managed to open a portal to somewhere else in Murder World, despite previous teleportation spells not working, and managed to get everyone through.</p><p>Unfortunately, Katy reappeared and broke Nico's leg, preventing her from following the others. In a desperate move, Nico shut the portal to make her stand against Apex, but was interrupted by the arrival of Chase, clade in his Darkhawk armor. Thinking she was saved, Nico apologized for her earlier actions. Sadly, Apex's control of technology extended to alien tech and she used him to mortally wound Nico before breaking her <a href=\"/staff-of-one/4055-40449/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40449\">Staff of One</a> and kicking her off a cliff. Nico crawled threw the snow towards her staff, ignoring her injuries. But she was to wounded and only just managed to touch her staff and utter a single word, \"<em>Help</em>,\" before dying, hand still tightly clasped around the staff.</p><p><del>Rest In Peace Nico Minoru, you will be missed.</del></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3366651\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.64347146207975\" data-width=\"1279\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3366651\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg 1279w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg 1279w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111123579/3366651-avengers+arena+012-007.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Luckily, the spell resurrected her and, due to the massive blood sacrifice, equipped her with a new arm, to replace the one she'd lost to Apex, and amplified her powers. Furious, Nico immediately tracked down Katy and engaged her. Viewing the fight from a hidden bunker, Arcade explains that Nico's powers come from the blood magic, and after losing her arm and bleeding out, her powers were amplified and her body rebuit. Arcade also believes that Nico's behavior has changed and that she is much darker now, after her resurrected.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nico seems to take an early advantage against Katy, but loses it when she sends Chase to attack her. Not wanting to hurt her friend causes Nico to hold back, resulting in her being knocked down by Katy's robots. Nico manages to destroy what's left of the sentinel and destroys Death Locket's robotic arm, rendering her useless to Katy. However, she still won't kill Chase which Katy uses to batter her until near death, causing her to drop her staff. Katy then picks up the staff and declares herself the winner. Nico then demonstrates her gauntlets ability to cast spells and knocks Chase out with a single magic punch. She also uses the gauntlet to recall the staff to her and casts a final spell which buries Katy and Death Locket alive. Chase, who survived the punch, then comforts Nico who wants to pretend that they aren't trapped in a deathmatch for awhile. Chase agrees and the two sit side by side in silence.</p><p>When Arcade floods Murder World with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/trigger-scent/4055-56712/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56712\">Trigger Scent</a> on Day 29, Laura goes into a frenzy and attacks the other teens and nearly kills Aiden and Nara. This forces Cullen to remove his <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/bloodstone-ring/4055-57820/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57820\">Bloodstone Ring</a>, which keeps his hidden monster side, a mystical soul parasite called a Glartrox, in check and he begins to attack Laura. However, before the monster can kill her, Reptil, Nico, and Chase appear and push him back. The trio are soon joined by Cammi and Anachronism while Nara searches the nearby water for Cullen's ring. Nico attempts to force the monster back into Cullen with her spells, but it doesn't work.</p><p>With things looking dire, Aiden is about to kill Cullen, which would stop the Glartrox, when Nara locates the ring and draws the monster towards her. She manages to touch the ring to its skin, banishing it back into Cullen, but not before it cuts her with its claws. She bleeds out and dies in Aiden's arms, which causes him to lash out at Cullen, swinging his axe into his chest. The alliance the teens previously had shatters, and Nico has Chase punch Reptil into the forest, while she grabs Cullen and flies out over the water.</p><p>Nico tries to drown him peacefully, but because of his ring, Cullen survives. She apologizes, claiming that it's not his fault and he deserves better, but that she has to look out for Chase. She promises to make his death quick and as painless as she can, but is interrupted by Cammi, who stole the <a href=\"/darkhawk-amulet/4055-56481/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56481\">Darkhawk Amulet</a> from Chase. Cammi berates Nico for succumbing to Arcade's machinations, to which Nico responds by claiming she already has, referring to her early burying of Apex and Death Locket. She expresses remorse for having seemingly killed Death Locket. All of a sudden, she realizes that Cammi has Chase's amulet and believes she has killed him.</p><p>The two take flight and attack one another, but stop once Chase, alive but immobilized by a broken leg, draws their attention to Hazmat, who is about to explode and kill them all. Reptil charges forward and gets Jenny into the water where she explodes safely, saving the other kids, who have now stopped fighting. When Apex, now in control of Murder World due to Arcade's escape, sees this, she activates the Island's many death traps and sends them after Nico, Chase, Cammi, and Aiden. The group engages in a losing battle against sand monsters, killer bugs, and a living typhoon.</p><p>Below Murder World, Death Locket escapes Katy's control and is forced to end the game by killing Apex with Tim in control. She then goes up to the surface and tells the group that it's over. When she tells them what happened, Nico, relieved that Rebecca lived, goes to thank her, but Rebecca asks her not to. Hazmat then emerges from the water, without her suit and not emitting her usual radiation, and they all agree not to tell anyone what happened during their 30-day absence.</p><p>On Day 30, the adults arrive, including <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\">Captain Britain</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/abigail-brand/4005-4441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\">Abigail Brand</a>, <a href=\"/maria-hill/4005-40824/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40824\">Maria Hill</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, and the kids were rescued. Chase gave the amulet back to Chris and all the teens left the island. One week later, after news of the story broke, Arcade made his move. In an undisclosed safe house, wrapped in a bathrobe and uncorking a bottle of champagne, Arcade uploaded the footage of what really happened in Murder World to the internet.</p><h3>Avengers Undercover</h3><p>Three months following the survivors escape from <a href=\"/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\">Arcade</a>'s death trap, Nico had difficulty settling back into her old life, due in part to her death and resurrection, and began spending time away from her team, the <a href=\"/runaways/4060-40440/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40440\">Runaways</a>. Unfortunately this lead to her missing <a href=\"/molly-hayes/4005-1936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1936\">Molly Hayes</a>' birthday. When fellow Murderworld survivor, <a href=\"/bloodstone/4005-86740/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86740\">Bloodstone</a>, goes missing while hunting for Arcade, <a href=\"/anachronism/4005-86739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86739\">Anachronism</a> has most of the survivors come together to search for him. Nico's first stop is grabbing <a href=\"/chase-stein/4005-1938/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1938\">Chase Stein</a>, who's doing an interview about his experiences, thereby violating the pact the group had made to never talk about the events inside Arcade's bubble. When Nico confronts him over this he retorts by pointing out how she's isolating herself from her friends, arguing that she never really came back from Murderworld. Nico ignores this and teleports him away to one of <a href=\"/ulysses-bloodstone/4005-10960/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10960\">Ulysses Bloodstone</a>'s manors, along with several others. When Aiden reveals that Cullen's last known location was entering <a href=\"/bagalia/4020-57907/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57907\">Bagalia</a>, home of <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Helmut Zemo</a>'s <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a>, the group agrees to go after him and rescue him from the supervillain city.</p><p>When the arrive at the entrance to the city, Nico levitates the group, consisting of herself, Chase, Aiden, <a href=\"/death-locket/4005-85857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85857\">Death Locket</a>, <a href=\"/hazmat/4005-69914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69914\">Hazmat</a>, and <a href=\"/cammi/4005-41747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41747\">Cammi</a>, down to the city proper. However they are spotted during the descent and set upon by numerous teenage villains, including <a href=\"/black-knight/4005-79532/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79532\">Black Knight</a>, <a href=\"/mako/4005-79533/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79533\">Mako</a>, <a href=\"/melter/4005-62023/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62023\">Melter</a>, <a href=\"/excavator/4005-2255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2255\">Excavator</a> and others. The group quickly defeats them and tracks Cullen to Arcade's bar, <a href=\"/the-hole/4020-58361/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58361\">The Hole</a>, only to discover that Cullen isn't being held hostage and is there of his own volition. After a bit of verbal sparring with Aiden, Cullen leaves the others only to be followed by Nico, who wants to make sure that being a villain is actually what he wants instead of him just trying to a new place for himself in society. It is at this point that she meets <a href=\"/hellstorm/4005-14695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14695\">Hellstorm</a>, who offers to tutor her in her black magic powers.</p><p>After four hours of clubbing, Cammi pulls the group out of the bar and tells them they're leaving but are more than welcome to return later. Cullen appears at this point, flanked by Daimon, <a href=\"/madame-masque/4005-13940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13940\">Madame Masque</a>, and <a href=\"/constrictor/4005-2127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2127\">Constrictor</a>, and has Daimon teleport them to an unknown location. When they reappear, the teens are wearing black and white formal wear and standing in a casino as the hostess announces the arrival of Arcade himself, at which point Cullen reveals that they're here to kill him. When Cammi attacks Cullen over his disregard for the groups wishes, Nico responds by knocking her away from him and telling her that she's being a hypocrite and that some of them need to see Arcade dead.</p><p>However, the group recognizes that they need to shut down Arcade's powers before they can escape or kill him and split into two groups. Nico, Cullen, and Rebecca go to shut down the generators supplying Arcade with powers, while Cammi, Chase, and Aiden protect Jenny, who become unresponsive when confronted by the man who killed her friends and boyfriend. Nico and the others manage to shut down the generator, despite being ambushed by <a href=\"/miss-coriander/4005-88615/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88615\">Miss Coriander</a>. The teen then procede to beat Arcade bloody but stop short of killing him. Hazmat, however, reawakens and kills him as revenge for <a href=\"/mettle/4005-69913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69913\">Mettle</a>.</p><p>After pointing out that there were no doubt multiple cameras recording their pre-meditated first degree murder, the group tries to flee the casino. Their fleeing is interrupted by the arrival of a <a href=\"/s-h-i-e-l-d-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\">S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier</a> and necromancers, who are able to disrupt Nico's spell-casting and arrest them. Whilst in the detention center, Nico and Chase are visited by Molly and <a href=\"/karolina-dean/4005-1943/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1943\">Karolina Dean</a>, the former of which blames Nico for getting Chase arrested and going crazy. But their stay with <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> is cut short when Daimon teleports them back to Bagalia, where they are greeted by the entire city cheering for them and their actions. The group is then escorted to Baron Helmut Zemo who invites them to join his Masters of Evil in exchange for which they'll have the freedom to determine their own lives, free from the strict moral restrictions placed on them by the superhero community.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1259701\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/1259701-bellj2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.28\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/1259701-bellj2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1259701\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/1259701-bellj2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/1259701-bellj2.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/1259701-bellj2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/34101/1259701-bellj2.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><b>Sister Grimm</b> Height: 5' 4\"</li></ul><ul><li><b>Weight:</b> 102 lbs.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Eyes:</b> Brown</li></ul><ul><li><b>Hair:</b> Black</li><li><b>Notable Aliases:</b> Sister Grimm</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Nationality:</b> American</li></ul><ul><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> unrevealed</li></ul><ul><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li></ul><ul><li><b>Education:</b> High School</li></ul><ul><li><b>Affiliations:</b> <a href=\"/runaways/4060-40440/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40440\">Runaway</a></li></ul><ul><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> <a href=\"/witchbreaker/4005-54963/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54963\">Witchbreaker</a> (Great Grandmother) Robert Minoru (Father), Tina Minoru (Mother)</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238374\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.835\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238374\"><img alt=\"Staff Release\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Staff Release\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg 400w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/238374-127650-nico-minoru.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Staff Release</figcaption></figure><p>She possesses the <a href=\"/staff-of-one/40449/\" data-ref-id=\"40449\">Staff of One</a>, a mystical artifact that allows her to cast amazing spells. However, a specific spell effect or manifestation can only be invoked once. Attempting to evoke the same effect results in random, often useless, effects. Being untrained in magic, Nico must verbalize the desired effect (directly or indirectly) using normal language. Nico mentioned wanting to expand her vocabulary to increase her versatility with the Staff. The potential power of the Staff is such that it could make even <a href=\"/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\">Dormammu</a> afraid (according to Nico's parents), which implies that Nico is only scratching the surface of what the Staff is truly capable of.</p><p>Nico must shed her own blood, in ways such as cutting herself, in order to manifest the <a href=\"/staff-of-one/40449/\" data-ref-id=\"40449\">Staff of One</a>, which emerges from her chest after invoking the words \"When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge.\" Once she forced <a href=\"/old-lace/4005-40610/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40610\">Old Lace</a> to bite her in order to conjure up the Staff. When Nico has her period, she does not have to cut herself. The <a href=\"/staff-of-one/40449/\" data-ref-id=\"40449\">Staff Of One</a> is reabsorbed into Nico's body after prolonged use.</p><p>She has occasionally used minor magic, such as conjuring a small image, without using the staff.</p><p>After the Runaway's trip to 1907 New York, Nico's Staff of One transformed in appearance to resemble the <a href=\"/witchbreakers-staff/4055-55801/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55801\">Witchbreaker's Staff</a>. It is now more powerful than it's original form. Also, after the Witchbreaker subjected her to a great amount of pain, Nico can now cast some spells without the staff in her possession.</p><p>After being resurrected by the Staff of One, it rebuild a new arm for Nico, that looked like a gauntlet. It seems that Nico can cast spells with her new arm without the Staff of One.</p><h3>List of spells cast</h3><p>Below is a list of spell that Nico (and in some very rare cases, others) have cast using the Staff of One. By definition, these spells are the spells that Nico can no longer cast, seeing as she cannot use a spell twice.</p><ol><li><b>\"Freeze.\"</b> Magically froze Gertrude Yorkes' mother for a short period of time.</li><li><b>\"Freeze.\"</b> Due to this spell already having been used, the Staff of One randomly summoned pelicans.</li><li><b>\"Smoke.\"</b> Produced a thick cloud of black smoke to cover the Runaways' escape.</li><li><b>\"Away.\"</b> Teleported Nico away from Alex Wilder.</li><li><b>\"Mud.\"</b> Summoned a blob of mud that flew right at Karolina Dean.</li><li><b>\"Burst!\"</b> Caused two spray-paint cans to explode.</li><li><b>\"Rock and roll.\"</b> Generated a tremor that resulted in the Hostel caving in on the Runaways and LAPD officers.</li><li><b>\"Waterproof!\"</b> Summons a impervious bubble for the team to travel underwater in.</li><li><b>\"Float on.\"</b> Levitated Chase Stein's powerless parents up to the roof and kept them there for a while.</li><li>(Off-panel).

Because of this Nico has had to mature the fastest in comparison to her friends, but she still maintains a positive outlook on life and looks to her friends as her family, so she also is the maternal figure of the group. But because Nico guards her friends so closely, she takes a loss much worse than they do, such as when she expressed survivor's guilt over Gert's death. Nico also shows quick thinking and ingenuity when using her spells.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>Runaways</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5880941\" data-ratio=\"0.56268656716418\" data-width=\"670\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 670px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5880941\"><img alt=\"Nico Minoru and the Runaways\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg 670w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nico Minoru and the Runaways\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg 670w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/5880941-runaways-tv-series-cast.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nico Minoru and the Runaways</figcaption></figure><p>Nico appears as one of the main characters in the live-action <em>Runaways</em> series, played by Lyrica Okano.</p><h3>Games</h3><h4>Marvel Avengers Alliance</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4222971-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4222971\" data-ratio=\"1.0112994350282\" data-width=\"177\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 177px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:101.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4222971-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4222971\"><img alt=\"Marvel Avengers Alliance\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" data-width=\"177\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4222971-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4222971-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.png 177w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Marvel Avengers Alliance\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4222971-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4222971-sin+t%C3%ADtulo.png 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" data-width=\"177\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Marvel Avengers Alliance</figcaption></figure><p>Nico is a reward character, and became playable, by completing the special operation 15 \"Game On\"</p><p>Her bio says: The Pride was an organization of six supervillain married couples, dedicated to the destruction of all of humanity... except for their own children.

For instance, there was once 18 universes in the dragon ball multiverse but for some reason Omni-King had a mood swing and erased 6 universes on the spot. Another glimpse of his power was when he erased future trunk's entire world out of existence. He did this because Zamasu affected that universe with evil and he said that he was annoying. He is above all the Angels, Demons, and Gods of Destruction by a long shot. He even has Beerus and Champa sweating and stuttering in his presence.</p>",

Oolong's greatest moment perhaps is preventing Emperor Pilaf from making his wish for world domination by stepping in at the last minute and wishing for the worlds' most comfortable pair of under ware.

The first king of Wakanda, Black Panther Bashenga, harnessed the mineral and used it to nurture his nation. Thousands of years later, under the ruling of Black Panther <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/tchaka/4005-62659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62659\">T\u2018Chaka</a>, Wakanda's level of technological and economic achievements continued to excel far beyond those of the modern world.</p><p>T'Chaka concealed Wakanda from the rest of world to prevent it from being manipulated by outsiders. His first wife, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/nyami/29-70733/\">N'Yami</a>, died while in labor with Prince T\u2019Challa. Years later, a Dutch scientist named Ulysses <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/klaw/29-3171/\">Klaw</a> found a way into Wakanda, created a vibranium sound-based weapon, and used it to kill King T\u2019Chaka.

Using his superhuman senses of sight, smell, and hearing combined with his enhanced panther-like reflexes, he divided his time as a king and crime fighter. During the characters first debut, Stan Lee scribes the African hero defeating the American superhero team, the Fantastic Four.</p><p>Several years later, in 1968, <a href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\">Roy Thomas</a> scribes the character's first appearance as an <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avenger</a>. In 1972, after the first four issues, the Black Panther becomes the titular character of <a href=\"/don-mcgregor/4040-44540/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44540\">Don McGregor</a>'s <em>Jungle Action</em>. McGregor's \"<a href=\"/panthers-rage/4045-55776/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55776\">Panther's Rage</a>\" is one of the most critically acclaimed stories of the Black Panther mythos. The co-creator of the Black Panther, Jack Kirby, would later go on to illustrate and scribe the hero's solo series in 1977.</p><p>In 1998, <a href=\"/christopher-priest/4040-41500/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41500\">Christopher Priest</a> began writing the Black Panther's following series. Priest modernized the character by building and expanding upon the Black Panther mythos mapped out by Lee and McGregor. In Priest's retcons of Wakanda, he established Bastet (the ancient Egyptian God) as the panther god that the Wakandans built their religious cult of the Black Panther around. Prior to this retcon, the Wakandan panther god did not have a name/origin. Priest's interpretation of the Black Panther is widely praised.</p><p>In 2005, TV/movie scribe <a href=\"/reginald-hudlin/4040-41772/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41772\">Reginald Hudlin</a> began writing the Black Panther. Hudlin's tenure retconned a lot of what was previously established about the character, as he rebooted the heroes adventures. However, major establishments, like T'Challa being a warrior king, all stayed true to the classic tales of the Black Panther. Hudlin's tenure on the Black Panther is the most commercially successful series of the Black Panther franchise. He also created <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a>, T'Challa's younger sister, who he would later scribe becoming the new Black Panther in 2009.</p><h2><strong>Major Story Arcs</strong></h2><h3>Defeating The Fantastic Four</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3205056\" data-ratio=\"0.97376093294461\" data-width=\"343\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 343px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3205056\"><img alt=\" Pledging his \"fortune, powers, and life to the service of all mankind.\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg 343w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Pledging his \"></noscript></a><figcaption> Pledging his \"fortune, powers, and life to the service of all mankind.\"</figcaption></figure><p>To test his powers, fighting skill, and genius, King T'Challa invited the American superhero team, the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a>, to Wakanda.

T\u2019Challa remained stateside in New York, attempting to uncover Achebe\u2019s other allies, because he knew that Achebe wasn't working alone. It is later revealed that Achebe was working with the United States intelligence community, Russia, and the Latin-American terrorist state, Domuyan, in an attempt to exploit Wakanda\u2019s vast technological advancements. However, King T'Challa had predicted that this would happen years prior, but was uncertain which of the three countries would initiate the attack first. He quickly began a counter maneuver.</p><p>T\u2019Challa presented the coup d'\u00e9tat to the U.N.

Hunter would do anything he could, no matter how violent, to appease King T\u2019Chaka. Upon becoming king, T\u2019Challa disbanded the Hatu Zeraze and Hunter decided to leave Wakanda, which is why he was in New York. T\u2019Challa accepted Hunter\u2019s offer of assistance and Hunter vowed absolute loyalty to him. However, T'Challa's acceptance was all a ruse.

T\u2019Challa later knocked him unconscious, regrouped with the others, and flew to Wakanda to face Achebe.</p><p>When he finally confronted Achebe at the Wakandan Palace, T'Challa allowed himself to be captured. He knew that Achebe would flee the country in fear, basically exiling himself, making him ruler again. When T\u2019Challa escaped Achebe\u2019s deathtrap, he was confronted by Hunter. The two engage in combat, which ended with T\u2019Challa using a pinched never technique.

As a result, the Wakandan-Skrull war began. T'Challa began to defend his nation with cunning tactics and technological marvels. Eventually, the two factions found themselves at a loss of technological weaponry. As a result, the two forces began to use old fashion and more primitive weaponry such as, the sword &amp; shield.

Namor asked T'Challa to join this \"Dark Illuminati\", to which he refused, citing his preference for the Illuminati.</p><p>Although he was a little annoyed at the refusal, Namor allowed T'Challa to peacefully leave.

Not surprised that T'Challa refused to join their \"<a href=\"/cabal/4060-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56051\">Cabal</a>\", Doom proceeded to attack him, pitting T'Challa and his Dora Milaje against him and his \"<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doombots/4060-59485/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59485\">doom-bots</a>\".</p><p>After a brutally epic battle, that resulted in T'Challa becoming gravely injured, the Dora Milaje and T'Challa fled Atlantis.

He began training his body to fight Doom and as a man of science, he resulted to using magic to prepare for war. While he was in a coma, Shuri became regent of Wakanda and the new Black Panther. T'Challa reached out to the powerful Wakandan alchemist, <a href=\"/zawavari/4005-60980/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60980\">Zawavari</a>. The witch doctor empowered him with acolytes, that enhanced his strength, senses, and provided him with a way to resist Doom's magic-based attacks.

Meanwhile, T'Challa, Shuri, and the Dora Milaje, teamed up with the Fantastic Four and a few X-Men in an attack on the Desturi. T'Challa and his allies managed to take back Wakanda, freeing all Desturi prisoners. Elsewhere, Doom infiltrated Wakanda and managed to steal a large amount of processed vibranium.</p><p>He ventured to his home nation, Latveria, where he began attacking various cities around the world by using the vibranium to manipulate all vibranium-based objects and structures. Storm, Shuri, the Dora Milaje, and the Fantastic Four were instructed to take out Doom's worldwide network facilities, while T'Challa initiated a plan to save the world. The heroes later traveled to Latveria to confront Doom.</p><p>T'Challa engaged in combat with Doom and managed to plant a remote device on him that made processed vibranium inert.The device was so powerful that all vibranium across the world became defunct. Doom's newly acquired vibranium-based armor was rendered useless and he was defeated. T'Challa then returned to Wakanda to store some remaining active vibranium, that was recovered with the help of Storm, the X-Men, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.</p><h3>Black Panther: Most Dangerous Man Alive</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211914\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211914\"><img alt=\"Black Panther: Man without Fear\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Panther: Man without Fear\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 900w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 632w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Panther: Man without Fear</figcaption></figure><p>In order to defeat Doctor Doom, during the events of <a href=\"/doomwar/4045-56115/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56115\">Doomwar</a>, T'Challa was forced to destroy Wakanda's vibranium reserves by making the substance inert.

Because the young girl was a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/x-gene-mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant</a>, the X-Men want to offer her to the Phoenix, believing her to be the savior of the mutant race. However, the Avengers want to conceal the girl in fear that the Phoenix would corrupt her, making her a potential threat to mankind.

Although some of their actions were generous and peaceful, the Avengers feared that such powerfully immense beings should not go unchecked. During the chaos that followed, T'Challa allied himself with the Avengers and Storm allied herself with the X-men. Many Wakandans were confused as to why their queen would ally herself with the X-Men and quickly declared her a traitor to the Wakandan Kingdom.</p><p>T'Challa provided a safe-house for the Avengers in Wakanda. In search of them, Namor attacked and almost sank Wakanda, killing hundreds if not thousands of its citizens. T'Challa was saddened and infuriated at the X-men as he declared them all enemies of his country. Storm later arrived in Wakanda and saw what Namor had done. She then approached T'Challa as he grieved for the lives that Namor had taken. Out of frustration at what had just happened, he scolded her. She attacked him (to his surprise) and the two began to fight.

Iron Man proposed that they form a government of superhumans similar to the United Nations that would meet regularly, in secret, to prevent an event like the Kree-Skrull War from happening again. After some debating, all except T'Challa agreed to form this \"<a href=\"../../illuminati/65-40421/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illuminati</a>.\" T'Challa declined at the time, because he felt that the group would fail, due to them deciding that they were going to attempt to secretly govern the world.</p><p>Sometime later, after the events of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">AvsX</a>, T'Challa reconsidered joining the Illuminati after witnessing an event known as an \"Incursion\". An incursion is when two alternate universes collide into each other with alternate Earths as the epicenter. T'Challa encountered <a title=\"Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-TRN265)\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Yabbat_Ummon_Turru_(Earth-TRN265)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Swan</a>, a woman from an alternate Earth who had destroyed her own Earth to prevent it from colliding with Earth-616. T'Challa was on an expedition, in the jungles of Wakanda, with some potential candidates for Wakanda's space program, when she attacked them.</p><p>After Black Swan ordered her mercenaries to kill several of his candidates, T'Challa killed them and managed to capture her. He then contacted the Illuminati to report what he had just witnessed. Upon joining them, he swore to kill fellow Illuminati member, Namor, for attempting to sink Wakanda during the events of AvsX. The Illuminati and the Black Panther go on to deal with several more incursions, attempting to avoid doing what Black Swan had done, which was to destroy one alternate Earth to prevent it from colliding with another. However, the group finally realized that destroying the alternate Earths was their best option.</p><p>As time progressed, the hostilities between Wakanda and Atlantis increased. In an attempt to end the feud, Namor presented a peace offering to T'Challa for him to relay to his sister, Queen Shuri, the current ruler of Wakanda. T'Challa presented the peace offering to Queen Shuri, but she discarded it, citing that Namor's actions during AvsX was an act of terrorism. She then ordered an attack on Atlantis, while T'Challa distracted Namor with a fraudulent acceptance. The <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hatut-zeraze/4060-55816/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55816\">Hatut Zeraze</a>, Wakanda's secret police, went on to decimate Atlantis.</p><p>The war conflict between the two men reached its breaking point during the Illuminati's battle with the <a href=\"/great-society/4060-60698/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60698\">Great Society</a>. T'Challa was poised to use an antimatter bomb to destroy the Society's world in order to save Earth-616, but refused to do so, as it would mean killing billions of innocent people. Namor then stole the detonator away and destroyed the planet anyway, claiming that he had the guts to do what T'Challa and the others would not. T'Challa savagely attacked Namor, but their confrontation was interrupted by the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. Namor was expelled from the Illuminati for his actions, and left to form a new iteration of the <a href=\"/cabal/4060-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56051\">Cabal</a>. For failing to destroy the Great Society's world (thus proving he does not have the will to defend Wakanda no matter what), the spirits of T'Chaka and the other past Black Panthers chastise T'Challa and shun him.</p><p>Eight months later, the Cabal had utterly decimated Wakanda. With the last survivors evacuated, T'Challa was given his father's ceremonial dagger by Shuri just before she was killed by <a href=\"/proxima-midnight/4005-90522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90522\">Proxima Midnight</a>. The fugitive members of the Illuminati later joined forces with the Avengers after Namor begged for help, explaining that the members of the Cabal (particularly <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>) had become too difficult to control. During the mission to trap the Cabal on an exploding world, T'Challa stabbed Namor and left him for dead. Unbeknownst to him, both Namor and the Cabal managed to survive.</p><h3>Secret Wars</h3><p>During the final incursion, Black Panther was one of the heroes that tried to stop Earth-1610 from destroying his Earth. After the vessel transporting the Earth's \"resurrection team\" was destroyed by the Children, Mr. Fantastic and Black Panther was forced to put the \"lifeboat\" in action. As the \"lifeboat\" was deployed, Manifold teleported numerous heroes into it including Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Captain Marvel, Cyclops, and Thor, which allowed them to survive the end of the Multiverse.</p><p>Black Panther and the other heroes in the life raft would later be awakened by Doctor Strange eight years after the end of the Multiverse and the creation of <a href=\"/battleworld/4020-51065/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51065\">Battleworld</a>, a planet cobbled together from the fragments of destroyed realities ruled by Doom.</p><p>Black Panther and the other heroes were later transported by Strange to confront the Cabal after a distress call was sent to him by one member of the Thor Corps, and after this Doom himself appeared to quell the fighting. When Doom tried to kill them, Doctor Strange teleported them across Battleworld, but at the cost of his own life. Black Panther ended up in the domain of Egyptia along with Namor.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6012801\" data-ratio=\"0.593\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6012801\"><img alt=\"With the Infinity Gauntlet\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"With the Infinity Gauntlet\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 1000w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>With the Infinity Gauntlet</figcaption></figure><p>Three weeks later, while Battleworld was in dsarray, T'Challa, with Namor, arrived to Strange's Hidden Isle of Agamotto, using the Key of Agamotto given to them by Strange, they entered, and after identifying themselves as member of the Illuminati to a projection of the deceased Sorcerer Supreme, they were given access to some powerful items Strange had collected over the years, including the Siege Courageous and an Infinity Gauntlet that worked only in Doomstadt. Black Panther and Namor next traveled to the Deadlands for reinforcements, and Black Panther used his title as the King of the Dead to convince the zombies to join the forces opposing Doom. Using the Siege Courageous, the two of them arrived to the battlefield along with the zombies, proclaiming that Doom's reign is over.</p><p>Doom tried to convince T'Challa that he would rebuild Wakanda if he would stop fighting, but he refused the offer and struck Doom down.

As the inhabitants of Battleworld were trying to run from their ultimate demise, Black Panther gripped tightly to the Reality Gem and was transported to his reborn native universe in the rebuilt Wakanda, to the time directly before the events of the incursions.</p><h3>The Ultimates</h3><p>T'Challa was approached by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a> about creating a problem solving team to deal with threats to Earth and the Universe on a cosmic scale. The team was formed consisting of Captain Marvel, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-marvel/4005-57033/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57033\">Blue Marvel</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spectrum/4005-11337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11337\">Spectrum</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ms-america/4005-78932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78932\">Ms America</a> and Black Panther. The first of their missions involved <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>, T'Challa teleported himself into deep space to meet with Captain Marvel and Blue Marvel and open a dialogue with Galactus. T'Challa conversed with him explaining how he knew about the chamber which Galactus incubated himself in, and that it was still out in space containing unconsumed power. Along with the help of the Ultimates the team managed to get Galactus back into the chamber, which he then emerged out of reborn as Galactus the Lifebringer.</p><p>The next problem that the Ultimates sought to solve was the timestream which had been broken due to the abuse of time travel. They came to the conclusion that they cannot see the extent of the damage from within the Omniverse. T'Challa along with the help of Blue marvel developed a vehicle which can allow them to leave all that is known to view the timestream from outside the Omniverse. Travelling through the universe and different dimensions such as the Superflow and the Neutral Zone, they eventually manage to break out and leave the Omniverse. However, the vehicle they were in could not withstand the conditions exposing the Ultimates leaving them vulnerable, only to be saved by Galactus. T'Challa explained to him that they were there due to time being broken, to which Galactus responded sharing with them his own view of the time flow.</p><p>T'Challa and the Ultimates also played a role in Civil War II due to their use of the visions of Ulysses a new Inhuman that supposedly predicted the future. The Ultimates acted on these visions trying to stop problems before they happened. Most notably T'Challa was present on the mission to stop the attack by Thanos predicted by Ulysses. They succeeded in capturing Thanos but at the cost of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">War Machine</a> who was killed in the battle. Thanos also subsequently escaped his holding cell but T'Challa and Blue Marvel managed to stop him again using their intellect to create a device to shut down Thanos' brain temporarily.</p><p>Eventually the Ultimates were disbanded due to T'Challa's actions in Civil War II where he publicly disagreed with Captain Marvels actions, claiming she had gone too far and an attack on him meant an attack on Wakanda. The American government could not continue with the Ultimates operations due to the political move by T'Challa leading to the disbanding of the Ultimates.</p><h3>A Nation Under Our Feet</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250922\" data-ratio=\"0.64819944598338\" data-width=\"361\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 361px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.8%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250922\"><img alt=\"Providing a glimpse into his true power\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png 361w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Providing a glimpse into his true power\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png 361w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black+panther+1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Providing a glimpse into his true power</figcaption></figure><p>8 months after the events of Secret Wars, Black Panther returned to his home in Wakanda as the king. After facing threats of cosmic levels, he finally sought to return to a normal life. His wish was not fulfilled when he returned to a revolution against the idea of his monarchy led by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zenzi/4005-127863/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-127863\">Zenzi</a>. At this time he is also coping with the seeming death of his sister, Shuri. With all of his pent up rage, he finally learned to release and revealed that for his entire life he was holding back. He vowed to demonstrate his true power from that moment forwards.</p><p>His rule however, was contested by opposition groups who believed he was not fit to rule and that he did not protect Wakanda from the threats it had faced. Two of the greatest Dora Milaje, the midnight warriors Aneka and Ayo opposed T'Challa and left the Dora Milaje to oppose his rule with the key phrase 'no one man'. They had found their own followers building up a community of people who wanted to leave the kings rule and took over the Jabari-Lands. Another group that opposed T'challa was called 'the people' lead by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tetu/4005-129745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-129745\">Tetu</a> a former student of the Wakandan philosopher <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/changamire/4005-132088/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-132088\">Changamire</a> who's teachings were used as the war drum for the rebels and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zenzi/4005-127863/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-127863\">Zenzi</a> who were the leaders of the rebels.</p><p>Tetu and Zenzi had amassed a fairly large amount of followers and even turned some into living bombs using repulsor technology one of which had detonated in the heart of Wakanda injuring Ramonda T'challa's mother. T'challa even recruited some of his friends from outside Wakanda to help him fight the rebels such as <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4050-7191/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-7191\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/manifold/4005-62072/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62072\">Manifold</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/misty-knight/4005-1491/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1491\">Misty Knight</a>. He even went to further lengths organising a counterrevolution council of dictators who had experience in dealing with revolution. However, he was betrayed and the evidence of this meeting with highly questionable characters got to the people of Wakanda which hurt the King's standing with the people even though he rejected all suggestions. While all this was going on T'challa was also working on bringing his sister <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a> back from the living death she was entrapped in during <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>'s invasion of Wakanda. He managed to succeed in doing this using the help of Manifold and returned Shuri back to life, though she now had supernatural powers.</p><p>With Shuri's help and the Changamire's speech to the people, support for T'challa and the government was back and he began to devise a way to defeat the rebels once and for all. Tetu and Zenzi amassed their forces for a final assault on the centre of Wakanda the forces held them off for a while with the help of Shuri and Manifold. Eventually the forces did break through to the city, but T'challa had lead Tetu and his forces to him. He had earlier gone to the necropolis the city of the dead to raise the past leaders of Wakanda to fight one last time. With their help T'challa managed to defeat the rebels and Tetu ending the rebellion.

Giant Man asks T'Challa to take him back to his lab when he notices that Hank had been bitten by a zombie. He questions Hank about the bite and he attacks him and he falls unconscious. He awakes and realises that his right arm and leg is missing and that Giant Man is keeping him prisoner as a source of food. With the help of Wasp, whose head remained animated, he eventually escapes the lab.</p><p>After making a crutch and tucking Wasp's head under his arm he makes his way through the ruins of the city and is confronted by the Acolytes, who mistake him for a zombie. After a failed attack, Black Panther joins forces with them and they aboard Asteroid M. While there he meets Forge and he helps build a cybernetic arm and leg for him. While here he also meets Lisa Hendricks who he later marries and has a son with.</p><p>Five years later, the Acolytes land Asteroid M in the middle of New York after a scan detected no movement on the planet. Black Panther, along with his wife and child, step into the world. Wasp comes with them, her hunger being replenished. It is around this time that T'Challa receives a call from a Black Panther from another reality who is having problems with zombified super-heroes on the Skrull home-world.</p><p>Forty years later, New York is now renamed Wakanda and T'Challa is now king. However, there is no reliable way to restore the population that once lived in the city. Frustrated with this, the Acolytes come up with a plan to remove T'Challa from the throne and hire an assassin the sneak into the Royal Palace. The assassin manages to stab T'Challa in the chest, and alerted by the intrusion, Wasp (now in her cybernetic body) attacks the assassin. T'Challa is critically injured and the only way he can survive is if he becomes a zombie, so Wasp bites him. With her hunger returning, Wasp tries to eat Lisa but is stopped by T'Challa and he joins her in eating the assassin instead.</p><p>A few weeks later, Reynolds, Hawkeye and Forge release T'Challa due to the leader of the Acolytes trying to kill them. However, they get caught and pre-occupied with the arrival of the Zombie Galacti. After fighting and defeating the zombies with the help of Spider-Man and Luke Cage who are cured of their hunger, they retreat to a new Wakanda and seal the zombies out of the palace by using a force field to keep them out. However, Gladiator and Bruce Banner are trapped inside as well and Gladiator dies when he attacks T'Challa. T'Challa and the others realise they are not well-mannered enough to protect the portal that the zombies come through and Reynolds reveals that T'Challa's dead son T'Channa is dressed as Colonel America and that Reynolds and Forge have planted Colonel America's brain in his son's body. T'Channa attacks his father but is then reminded of who he is.</p><p>The zombies then return and release the force field and T'Challa and the group defeat them, but Iron Man manages to get through. After Banner deactivates the force field, the zombies get through to the survivors, but realise they are not hungry. However, during the fight before, T'Challa gets smashed, which left him with only with his arm, leg, chest, neck and head attached and Wasp crushed from the waist up. After the zombies cope with their newly found humanity, the Hulk breaks into the room, eats Reynolds and kills Iron Man, Phoenix, Firelord and Hawkeye before being stopped by Spider-Man, Giant Man and Wolverine.</p><p>After getting a new body by Forge, the zombies help the survivors get supplies and breed in other dimensions. However, Malcolm Cortez, the leader of the Acolytes reveals he was behind the assassination attempt on T'Challa, T'Channa's death and a plot to kill K'Shamba, Panther's grandson. He says he likes this way of life and wants to get rid of the zombie plague and sends T'Challa to another dimension.

When lawless ivory hunter Ulysses Klaw murdered T'Chaka in an attempt to possess the country's rare Vibranium deposit, a grief-stricken T'Challa swore vengeance and succeeded in thwarting the butcher's raid. In the process, the young prince destroyed Klaw's hand. T'Challa returned to his homeland after recieving a degree in physics ready to assume the mantle of leadership. To do so, he needed to defeat six of Wakanda's greatest warriors in unarmed combat, and obtain the secret heart-shaped herb that grants the country's chieftains their powers. Successfully carrying out the dual challenge, T'Challa donned the ceremonial garb of the Black Panther, totem of the Wakandan people. Under T'Challa, Wakanda has become one of the wealthiest and technologically advanced nations on the planet. After meeting Captain America, the Panther was offered membership in the Avengers.</p><h3>Ruins (Earth-9591)</h3><p>He is known as T'Challa des Wakandas and is a member of the Black Panther Party imprisoned alongside Bobby Seale and Huey P.

During the Vision's assault on the Avengers, Black Panther fought against him alongside his teammates.</p><h3>Earth X - (Earth-9997)</h3><p>The history of the Black Panther in this reality is similar to that of the Panther in the 616 mainstream. However, in this reality, the heart shaped herbs that granted him his powers also grant them to anyone else who takes them. Due to the nature of his mutation, however, T'Challa's powers are partially subconscious. In the recent history of this reality, Captain America gives T'Challa the Cosmic Cube of Safe Keepings as he believes that Panther would not use the device or give it to anyone else. During this time, he marries Storm and humanity begins to mutate due to the Terrigen Mists in the Earth's atmosphere. Due to this, T'Challa has more of a panther appearance while the animals in Wakanda which were part of a wildlife reserve that Panther set up, began to mutate as well becoming humanoid creatures known as Ani-Men. When the Skrull begin to take over the United States, Captain America asks T'Challa to give him the Cosmic Cube. Out of respect for his friend, he denies his friend's request and does not involve himself in the final battle against the Skrulls. After the death of the celestial embryo in the Earth's core, the axis shift of the Earth turns Africa into a frozen wasteland, but thanks to Beast's technology, Wakanda maintains its tropical ecosystem and keeps out most threats.</p><p>When Mar-vel comes to Wakanda in search of the Cosmetic Cube to destroy Death, T'Challa refuses to give him the Cube. It isn't until Storm is killed by a Wendigo attack and suddenly brought back to life that Mar-vel reveals that the Cube is responsible for that and the mutation of the Ani-Men because it was acting on Panther's wants. This revelation mortifies Panther and he hands the Cube over to Mar-vel who leaves to help the Wakandans relocate to the Savage Land so that they can escape the frequent Wendigo attacks that keep occurring. On the way to the Savage Land, Black Panther is followed by the Wendigo. He defeats them and discovers that they are really the Multiple Man in disguise. T'Challa and Storm help build a new Wakandan nation in the Savage Land with the help of everyone who travels with them. They are attacked by Belasco and the Dire Wraiths but are quickly saved by Mar-vel and his friends. A few months later, T'Challa accompanies Storm to the wedding of Medusa and King Britain, where they meet Bloodstorm. She asks Storm to perform a blood transfusion to cure her of her vampirism. Storm agrees to the procedure and it is unknown what happens to Black Panther went after this point.</p><h3>Marvel Manga-verse (Earth- 2301)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637720\" data-ratio=\"1.4472843450479\" data-width=\"626\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 626px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637720\"><img alt=\"Earth-2301 Mangaverse\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 626w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 442w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Earth-2301 Mangaverse\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 626w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 480w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Earth-2301 Mangaverse</figcaption></figure><p>In the Marvel Manga-verse, T\u2019Challa is still King of Wakanda and when calling upon the help of the God Qamatha, he can transform into a Were-Panther.

In retaliation, Black Panther sends \"Panther Tanks\" to Atlantis and destroys Namor's throne room. This leads to Namor unleashing an endless horde of sea-beasts upon the now-flooded Wakandan Capital, which in turn lead to more retaliatory strikes from Black Panther. The war continues until both Wakanda and Atlantis are laid to waste and left in total ruins.</p><h2><strong>In Other Media</strong></h2><h3><strong>Television</strong></h3><h4><strong><a href=\"/xmen-the-animated-series/4075-26/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-26\">X-Men: The Animated Series </a>(1992)</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5899730-black+panther+cameo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5899730\" data-ratio=\"0.75581395348837\" data-width=\"258\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 258px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5899730-black+panther+cameo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5899730\"><img alt=\"Black Panther's cameo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px\" data-width=\"258\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5899730-black+panther+cameo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5899730-black+panther+cameo.jpg 258w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Panther's cameo\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5899730-black+panther+cameo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5899730-black+panther+cameo.jpg 258w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px\" data-width=\"258\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Panther's cameo</figcaption></figure><p>Black Panther makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the Season 4 episode \"Sanctuary: Part 1,\" where he witnesses Magneto arriving in Africa and transporting the gathered Mutants to <a href=\"/utopia/4020-41752/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\">Asteroid M</a>.

The Z-Fighters then decide to travel to planet Namek, so they could wish Piccolo back to life. When they arrived, they learned that an alien named Freeza was also after the Dragon Balls. Eventually, Piccolo was wished back and arrived on Namek. While on Namek, he fused with a Namekian named Nail. With this increase in power, Piccolo battled <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Frieza</a>, completely dominating the fight while Frieza was in his second form. They fought evenly for a period of time, until Freeza unveiled his third transformation, after which he began to dominate over Piccolo. Piccolo had managed to put up a valiant fight against the tyrant, even coming out on top in a few instances. But in the end, Freeza had managed to overpower the fused Namekian, injuring him badly in the process. </p><h3>Android Saga</h3><p>When a boy from the Future named Trunks, warned the Z-Fighters about cyborgs coming in two years, Piccolo and the others started preparing. Even with their hard work, the cyborgs were too much for them. Soon another Android named Cell arrived. Realizing they need more time, the Z-Fighters were going to use the Room of Spirit and Time to gain more training. While the others were training, Piccolo fused with Kami-sama. After this fusion, Piccolo had managed to seek out cell and attempted to question him. Cell, however, was reluctant to give him any positive answers, so piccolo took him on a fight. Piccolo was easily outpaced Cell in the battle, actually coming close to defeating him, when Cell tried to absorb Piccolo and almost succeeded. During the resulting quarrel, Cell shows off his mastery of the Kamehameha wave and blows off Piccolo's arm. Piccolo pretends to have given up and ready to submit, asking Cell to tell him about why he is here and how he got here before he would allow Cell to kill him. This was actually a bluff, as Piccolo was just stalling for enough time so his arm would grow back.

He matches #17 blow for blow during their fight, seemingly overpowering him and managing to land stronger attacks than the cyborg, but a cyborg never runs out of his Ki, which allows him to keep up. Their fight was interrupted when Cell arrived. Piccolo was defeated while trying to defend the the cyborgs.

Piccolo was later killed when the planet Earth was destroyed by Buu, but was brought back along with the other victims by the Namekian Dragonballs. </p><h2>Dragonball GT</h2><h3>Bebi Saga</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6130/151425-77360-piccolo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-151425\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7893175074184\" data-width=\"337\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 337px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6130/151425-77360-piccolo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-151425\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\" data-width=\"337\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6130/151425-77360-piccolo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6130/151425-77360-piccolo.jpg 337w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6130/151425-77360-piccolo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6130/151425-77360-piccolo.jpg 337w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\" data-width=\"337\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Bebi is defeated, the people controlled by him regain control of their own selves and must get to safety because the planet that Bebi had created was going to eventually explode. Goku manages to get most of them back to Earth, but soon loses his Super Saiyajin 4 form from too much energy use. Piccolo arrives and gives him enough energy to teleport, but only enough to teleport Goku. Goku doesn't know this and teleports without him, leaving Piccolo behind. Piccolo is then ultimately killed in the explosion of the planet. </p><h3>Super Android 17 Saga</h3><p>During this saga, Piccolo lives in heaven as all of hell breaks loose into Earth by a portal created between hell Android 17 and #17 on Earth. Piccolo asks Lord Enma if he can go to hell so he can help Goku escape from hell and re-enter Earth by the same portal created by the #17's. Lord Enma denies the request, so Piccolo pretends to act like Piccolo Daimao and destroys the landscape around him. Lord Enma is enraged by this and tells Piccolo that he is going to hell. Piccolo is sent to hell to help Goku return to Earth, after Goku defeats Cell and Freeza. Piccolo opens the same portal with Dende and, at first, they mess up but finally they manage to get the right timing and open the portal. Piccolo tells Goku to hurry and get out, because he couldn't hold it for long. Goku thanks Piccolo and goes through the portal. Piccolo then stops and falls down from fatigue. Piccolo is then left alone in hell and stays there. </p><p> </p><h2>Fusions</h2><h3>Nail</h3><p>When Piccolo was resurrected and teleported to planet Namek, he saw Nail laying on the ground after being nearly beaten to death by Frieza. Nail offers to fuse with Piccolo, granting him enough power to battle second-form Frieza. </p><h3>Kami</h3><p>Piccolo again uses Namekian Fusion to fuse with Kami. With Kami being the good-side of the ancient Namekian, Piccolo becomes whole and is granted enough power to battle the Androids. </p><p> </p><h2>Powers/Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412588-PiccoloChargingUpABlast.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-412588\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.79699248120301\" data-width=\"266\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 266px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412588-PiccoloChargingUpABlast.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-412588\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" data-width=\"266\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412588-PiccoloChargingUpABlast.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412588-PiccoloChargingUpABlast.gif 266w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412588-PiccoloChargingUpABlast.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22757/412588-PiccoloChargingUpABlast.gif 266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" data-width=\"266\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Piccolo is one of the strongest characters in the DragonBall Universe, and has a variety of unique abilities that come from hard training and also because he is a Namekian. </p><p><b>Namekian Traits:</b> As a Namekian, Piccolo has several abilities that humans don't have. He possesses vast amounts of strength, speed, and durability due to his Namekian physiology. Piccolo's ears are good enough where he had heard a conversation from several miles away. Another trait that Namekians have are the ability to expand their bodies, allowing them to grow and stretch their limbs. One of Piccolo's greatest abilities is his ability to heal rapidly from major wounds done to his body. As long as his head remains intact, Piccolo is said to be able to regenerate from any injury. Namekians also don't require food, though they need water and air. Namekians also reproduce without mating by regurgitating an egg.</p><p><b>Training Skills:</b> Piccolo is one of the greatest fighters in the DragonBall Universe through his intense training. Through training, Piccolo has developed the ability to fly and produce energy blasts from almost any point of his body. He also has vast superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes that have come from his intense training. Using his ki, Piccolo has developed special moves such as the Special Beam Cannon, Masenko, and others. Another ability Piccolo developed was to make copies of himself, though this divides his powers equal to the number of copies he makes. Piccolo has also shown the ability to make objects appear, such as clothing and swords. This could be magic in origin. </p><p><strong>Superhuman Strength:</strong> Piccolo's Namekian physiology grants him vast levels of superhuman physical strength which can be further augmented by using telekinesis. Piccolo has been shown knocking down Android 17 hard enough that a large crater was created by the impact. Piccolo has overwhelmed Imperfect Cell with his physical strength. He has overpowered Android 17 with physical strength. On more than two occasions, Piccolo has shown to possess physical strength greater than that of the Androids and he has shattered entire cliffs and large rock formations with his fists. Throughout Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT, Piccolo's physical strength increased to the point that when he was sent to Hell by King Yemma for blasting Heaven, he took control of Hell and created order to keep the villains at bay. These villains include Bojack, Frieza, Perfect Cell, Cooler, etc., which would imply that Piccolo had enough power to keep these villains under his control. Piccolo's current power level is possibly beyond Super Saiyan 2 level and his physical strength allows him to lift in the excess of 1000 tons with no known upper limit. Piccolo can grow even larger in size, which further increases his physical strength. </p><p><b>Superhuman Speed:</b> His Namekian physiology grants him great superhuman speed. Piccolo thinks, reacts and moves at superhuman speeds. Piccolo is constantly said to be one of the fastest Z-Fighters of all. Piccolo's superhuman speed apply when he is thinking as he thinks extremely fast, his reflexes and reactions are incredibly rapid as he dodges lightning fast attacks that cannot be seen by the human eye and he moves and flies much faster than any Z-Fighter. Piccolo is depicted as flying incredibly fast well over supersonic speed (the speed of sound) and is able to fly at highly intense and harsh atmospheric pressures, temperatures and environments. Piccolo is able to move so fast that he is able to leave an after-image of himself behind. </p><h3>Techniques</h3><p><strong>Antenna Blast</strong> - A blast of electric energy shot from the antennas on Piccolo's head. According to video games, Piccolo inherited this ability from his father <a href=\"/piccolo-daimao/4005-61755/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61755\">King Piccolo</a>. This move is used to stun an opponent for a followup attack. </p><p><strong>Chasing Bullet</strong> - Fired in a similar way to the Demon Explosive Wave, but with less power. This attack is capable of homing in on and tracking a target to extreme lengths.</p><p><strong>Demon Explosive Wave</strong> - Piccolo fires an energy blast from one arm while using the second arm to support it. This is a very damaging attack.</p><p><strong>Destructive Wind</strong> - A charged air blast attack originally used on Nappa. The advantage of this attack is that it's hard to see since it is simply charged air. </p><p><strong>Evil Containment Wave</strong> - A technique where the user sacrifices his own life force to seal an enemy in a specially prepared container. Piccolo developed a method to reverse this wave and learned how to initiate it once he merged with <a href=\"/kami-sama/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\">Kami</a>.</p><p><strong>Eye Lasers</strong> - A quick fire technique used to injure opponents or cancel energy attacks. Piccolo inherited this from King Piccolo.</p><p><strong>Flight</strong> - Piccolo is able to fly under his own power.</p><p><strong>Great Namekian Ability</strong> - Piccolo can increase his size and strength to extreme levels. This is a powerful Namekian ability though this makes his weak spots more vulnerable. This was only used to fight Goku in the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament. </p><p><strong>Hellzone Grenade</strong> - A scattershot technique where Piccolo fires many energy blasts in the general direction of his opponent. After sending numerous energy blasts into the air, Piccolo suspends them in mid-air around the opponent and then causes them all to hit at once. </p><p><strong>Hyper Explosive Demon Wave</strong> - Piccolo creates a large explosion with him at the epicenter of the blast in an attempt to destroy everything around him in one final attack. During the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, this was Piccolo's trump card though Goku blocked it.</p><p><strong>Light Grenade</strong> - Piccolo brings both his hands together in front of his chest and starts to form a yellow energy blast of great power. This attack was only perfected after he fused with Kami.</p><p><strong>Magic Materialization</strong> - An ability inherited from his father King Piccolo, Piccolo is able to form objects out of thin air. He has been seen recreating his white cloak and turban along with a uniform and sword for Gohan when he started training him. </p><p><strong>Masenko</strong> - A move where the user places both their hands above their head and fires an energy beam attack that is comparable to the Kamehameha Wave. This move is mostly used by <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, but Piccolo is the one who taught him the technique.</p><p><strong>Mouth Energy Wave</strong> - Piccolo is able to fire a powerful blast from his mouth. This is inherited from his father King Piccolo.</p><p><strong>Multi Form</strong> - A technique possibly learned from <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tien</a>, Piccolo is able to split his form into multiple beings. Piccolo first used this ability against <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a>. Piccolo usually uses this ability as a form of training so he can fight himself.</p><p><strong>Mystic Attack</strong> - The Namekian ability to stretch their arms to extreme lengths. Piccolo usually reserves this as a surprise attack.</p><p><strong>Scatter Shot</strong> - Piccolo fires multiple energy blasts at his opponent in an effort to overwhelm them.</p><p><strong>Special Beam Cannon</strong> - One of Piccolo's signature attacks, this move was originally developed to kill Goku. Piccolo places two fingers on his forehead and charges the attack. This is a long process, but when Piccolo is finished he fires two beams from his fingertips. One beam is straight while the second curls around the first, drilling through targets and exploding ones it cannot pierce. Piccolo has stated that this attack moves at the speed of light, making it nearly impossible to dodge. As time has passed, Piccolo has shown to be able to perform the technique within a matter of seconds as his control over it increased.</p><p><strong>Telekinesis</strong> - Piccolo is able to move objects with his mind.</p><p><strong>Telepathy</strong> - Piccolo is able to communicate via telepathy.</p><h2>Alternate Timeline</h2><p>In the alternate timeline where Goku died of a heart virus and the Z-Fighters were never warned about the Androids eventual attack, Piccolo was the first to fight the Androids and was swiftly killed by Android 17 via a swift kick to the chest. With Piccolo's death, Kami perished as well and the Dragon Balls were rendered useless. The only survivor was Gohan, who used the pain of seeing his teacher Piccolo die to turn himself into a <a href=\"/super-saiyan/4015-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55690\">Super Saiyan</a>. </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

However, Raditz was disappointed to find out that Goku's programming had been erased, and Goku had instead of used his powers to take over the world as his programming had been set to, he had helped the people of Earth. Raditz took <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> as a hostage, and warned Goku that if he didn't join him, he would kill his son. Goku would not join Raditz, <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> and Goku united to battle Raditz.</p><p>Gohan watched the battle from inside the Saiyan's space ship. During this, Gohan's rage is unleashed, and attacks Raditz with one single blow, enough for Goku to put his opponent on a head lock. Piccolo takes advantage and blasts at both of them with the extremely powerful move known as the Makankossapo, killing both Goku and Raditz. Just before Raditz died, Piccolo told him that Goku would live because of the seven magical <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragon Balls</a>. Raditz surprised him by telling Piccolo that he had transmitted this information to two more powerful saiyans ( <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a> and <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>), and that they would arrive in search for the Dragon Balls in one year.</p><h2>After Death</h2><p>When Goku reached the checkout station and was preparing to jounrey to King Kai's planet for training, Goku asked King Yemma what became of his brother's soul. Yemma states that Raditz caused a lot of trouble when he arrived and King Yemma had to fight him order to send him to hell. Yemma used his patented Yemma lock to subdue Raditz. Once Goku reached King Kai's planet and began his training King Kai invited Raditz to his planet for a chance at defeating Goku, but he was unable to defeat his him and sent back to hell.</p><p>Later Raditz learned of King Yemma's fruit and defeated the trolls guarding the fruit. Goku was sent with Gregory and Bubbles to stop Raditz in hell. Raditz planned on eating the fruit and becoming more powerful than King Yemma. Raditz was once again defeated by Goku.</p><p>When Gohan was looking for the final Dragon ball to revive his father he had to seek help from <a href=\"/uranai-baba/4005-61822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61822\">Fortuneteller Baba</a> and since he could not pay her fee Gohan was forced to fight her fighters like his father had to do when he was younger.

Piccolo's blast was completely useless against Raditz.Raditz was able to tank the blast with no ill effects. Raditz can effortlessly catch a bullet,which was fired from a farmer.In relation to the rest of the Saiyan army and Freeza's World Trade organization, Raditz is a low level solider who gets little respect and is barley more powerful than the Saibamen used by Nappa. Even so Raditz is capable of moving faster than the human eye can track, fire energy blasts, fly under his own power, and smash stone with his strength.

  "deck": "Recoome was the muscle of the Ginyu Force, second in power only to the squad captain.",
  "description": "<p>Reacoom (Recoome in the dub) is a large, muscular human-like alien with red hair. He is the most flamboyant member of the <a href=\"/ginyu-force/4060-40742/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40742\">Ginyu Force</a>, seen striking poses more often in battle than <a href=\"/captain-ginyu/4005-40734/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40734\">Captain Ginyu</a> himself, and generally behaving in a deceptively goofy manner, however Reacoom is actually fairly intelligent, not to mention sadistic, as he greatly enjoys toying with his opponents and egging them on with taunts.</p><p>Of all the members of the Ginyu Force, Reacoom is the one who does the most damage to the Z Warriors. His exact power level is not known, but he appears to be as strong as <a href=\"/burter/4005-45718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45718\">Butta</a> and <a href=\"/jeice/4005-40735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40735\">Jheese</a>, perhaps slightly more powerful. When Captain Ginyu has his men play Janken to divy up <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Kuririn</a> and <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>, Reacoom wins hands-down and gets to fight with Vegeta. Despite Vegeta striking first, throwing Reacoom into a mountain and blowing it up, and using a number of other crafty and underhanded tactics and techniques, Reacoom dominates the battle, apparently taking little damage from Vegeta's attacks except for his armor being destroyed and (later) his hair being burned off. It's likely that Reacoom would have killed Vegeta with his Eraser Gun attack had Gohan and Kuririn not stepped in, with Kuririn attacking Reacoom from behind while Gohan pulls the wounded Vegeta out of the path of Reacoom's attack.</p><p>Reacoom's only ill effects from Kuririn's attack are a few loose teeth, and after Butta and Jheese (bored by this point and anxious to leave) give him permission to fight the two Earthlings as well, he nearly kills Kuririn with a single kick to the head. Gohan he takes his time with, apparently admiring the boy's bravery and tenacity, but he ultimately brings the game to an end by breaking his neck with another kick. As he is about to finish off all three of them, <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a> arrives, and after healing them using <a href=\"/senzu-beans/4055-52211/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-52211\">senzu beans</a>, proceeds to defeat Reacoom by elbowing him in his stomach as he began warming up for his most powerful attack in a theatrically hammy fashion. The redheaded giant then keels over unconscious, much to the shock of everyone. Later, after Vegeta kills Butta, he also kills Reacoom, completely destroying his body with a huge ki blast (although in a later episode, a blooper results in Reacoom's perfectly intact corpse remaining on the battlefield).</p><p>He later travels to <a href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\">North Kai\u014d</a>'s planet with the other members of the Ginyu Force. There they find <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tenshinhan</a>, <a href=\"/chao-zu/4005-19773/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\">Chaozu</a> and Yamcha. Reacoom gets to fight with Yamcha, who was holding back on him, because he saw what Reacoom did to Vegeta. After <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a> realises that Reacoom is on a lower level than he is, Reacoom is quikly disposed off and sent into Hell along with the rest of the Ginyu Force. In the English dub, while in the prison of Hell, he offers an arm-wrestling challenge to anyone in their cell, but the only reply he gets is a unified \"Shut Up!\" from the rest of the Ginyu Force.</p><p>Reacoom is one of the longest lasting Ginyu Force members in terms of screentime, though chronologically he is defeated second and dies not long after. He is also the first member of the Ginyu Force to appear onscreen during the team's elaborate introductory routine to <a href=\"/frieza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>. Reacoom also makes a small appearance in Dragonball GT and it shows him flying out of hell with the other villains.</p><p>Reacoom's Japanese name, Rikuumu, is the Japanese word for cream kur\u012bmu (cream) rearranged. Viz went with the spelling of Reacoom in the DBZ manga to reflect this pun. He returns in the movie Fusion Reborn along with Butta, Jheese and <a href=\"/guldo/4005-40732/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40732\">Gurd</a>.</p><p>Reacoom has some powerful techniques and his signature technique is the Eraser Gun which allows him to fire a purple blast from his mouth which deals massive damage and likely erases the weaker target hence its name. Reacoome's strongest technique is the Reacoom Ultra Fighting Bomber at which he gathers enough ki around his body and lets out a powerful surge of energy that destroys everything in it's radius. While not shown in the anime nor manga, it is shown in the video games.</p><p> </p><p>Recoome appears in a lot of video games such as:</p><p> </p><ul><li>DBZ Budokai (all games)</li><li>DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi (all games)</li><li>DBZ Raging Blast 1 and 2</li><li>DBZ Xenoverse 1 and 2</li></ul>",

  "deck": "Othon von Salzas was an intergalactic pirate who became the very first Metabaron.",
  "description": "<p>Othon von Salzas lived his life as a space pirate until he met Edna, the woman who would be his wife. The story of their meeting is a mystery, but they quickly fell in love. Othon gave up pirating and moved to Marmola, the planet Edna's family lived on and ruled. Edna's father, Baron Berard of Castaka, never approved of Othon, but he didn't stop his daughter from marrying him. Othon took up his new family's business of carving marble. </p><p>Marmola was a planet made entirely of marble and all the richest men came from around the galaxy to purchase finely cut marble from the Castaka's. In addition to their amazing stone cutting techniques, the Castakas had a secret. In caves beneath the planet was a blue substance called epiphyte that when placed into objects made them defy gravity. The epiphyte was used to transport the huge blocks of marble since the Castaka's didn't use very much advanced technology.        </p><p>One day dignitaries from the Imperial Merchants Guild arrived on the planet and purchased some marble. While it was being cut there was an accident and tons of marble fell on Othon, trapping him. Edna knew it would take too long to cut the marble away so she demanded that her father use the epiphyte to free Othon but Berard said no, refusing to reveal the secret of the epiphyte in front of the dignitaries. Other stone cutters sided with Edna and Berard was overruled. As soon as Othon was freed and learned what had happened he was furious. He knew that revealing their secret would cause an intergalactic war when everyone found out about the epiphyte and decided they wanted it for themselves. When Berard saw Othon's anger he finally accepted him as his son, but the damage had been done.       </p><p>That night, the dignitaries left with their marble and Berard held a meeting. During the meeting he and Othon took out weapons and fought. Berard took a hit to lure Othon into striking range. Berard won but spared Othon, teaching him one last lesson about sacrifice. Following their battle Berard opened his shirt and showed Othon the Castakan birthmark, a glowing white bird in the center of his chest. He said that the mark is passed down from baron to baron and said that it now belonged to Othon. Berard didn't want to be alive when the war for the epiphyte began so he willed the birthmark onto Othon's chest and held his breath until he died.       </p><p>Ten days later, the battle began. Ships from all over the galaxy warred in the skies above Marmola and after a time only the Black Endoguard remained. On the planet, Othon's wife (Edna) and son (Bari) were ready to fight the entire legion of Black Endoguard warriors, an army that numbered over 4500, but Othon told them to wait. He had a plan but his family wouldn't hear it. Othon broke Bari's legs so he couldn't get out into battle but Edna got past him and ran out of the castle to be shot to pieces. After his wife's death Othon told his army the plan. He ordered his army to split into two and take the Black Endoguard from the North and South, and engage that in close combat, the specialty of Othon's people. Othon let his two best generals go into battle and attack from the sides while he went alone to combat them head on. By the end of the battle Othon had killed more than 1500 men with nothing but a dagger. After the fight, Othon paid respects to his lost friends and family and took after his son.</p> <p> A week later the Imperial Couple arrived on Marmola and they worked out a deal to get the epiphyte. Othon was made obscenely rich, was given a new planet, and was gifted with the last horse in the galaxy, which he gave to his son. Bari formed a deep connection with his steed while his legs healed but one night thieves came to the planet and stole it. Bari went after them but Othon didn't think he would catch the criminals since his legs were still weak. Othon took off after them in the dense fog and killed the first three without a problem. The last one was riding away on the horse and Othon threw his spear through its chest and unhorsed the man. Othon drew closer and was horrified to see that he had killed his son. While he was grieving the last thief shot him and destroyed his pelvis. Othon killed him and was only able to make it back to his palace with the aid of his dead son's horse.       </p><p>Othon got cybernetic implants to repair his damaged body (starting the metabaronic tradition of mutilation and mechanical replacements) and spent a large part of his fortune creating the first metabaronic weapons. Filled with suffering and rage after the loss of his son and inability to have another (since his destroyed reproductive organs had been replaced with machinary like the rest of his pelvic area) Othon became a violent and dangerous man. He kept his two concubines although they could not satisfy him, and they were not allowed to speak in his presence.        </p><p>One night Othon heard news that the royal couple's fetus had finally been created (the emperor was sterile so the fetus had to be made in a lab on a far away planet) and that it was being transported to the royal couple. Othon new that if he had heard it then criminals and pirates would have as well and that the fetus was in danger. Sure enough the transport ship was attacked by ships launched from a hidden base disguised as a planet. The Purple Endoguard ships defending the transport ship were outnumbered and while they could hold off the attackers, they couldn't defeat them. The battle went on for weeks and the call went out for anyone with ideas to turn the tide. Othon, a brilliant strategist, had a plan immediately and flew to the golden planet where the royal couple lived. Once he landed the guards tried to stop him because he had come unannounced, but he took down any man who stood in his way and walked straight up to the royal couple. He told them his plan and was given the remaining ships of the fleet and flew to the battle. The other ships were painted to hide in an asteroid field while Othon to his ship to the planet/base and attacked it. When the enemy ships saw their base under attack they flew through the asteroids to reach Othon but where destroyed by the hidden ships. Othon then went to take his place at the head of the ships protecting the transport vessel but he was ordered to go to the back. Insulted, he flew his ship through the armored transport, stole the fetus, and flew off to the golden planet at faster-than-light speeds that no other ship had ever, or would ever, reach.       </p><p>When Othon reached the golden planet and presented the royal family with their child (male and female Siamese twins joined at the back, a prophecy fulfilling child) he was knighted as Metabaron. The royal couple promised Othon a that they would search the galaxy for a gift that would fulfill him.        </p><p>Some time later an imperial vessel landed on Othon's planet. His gift had arrived. Into his castle walked a woman that was to be his wife. The woman was Honorata, a priestess of Shabda-Oud. The priestesses were largely considered whores and witches so Othon was not pleased to see her at first. When he looked into her eyes though, that changed. Othon's concubines pleaded for him to kill her and said she had put a spell on him, but Othon sent them away. </p><p>Othon and Honorata soon fell madly in love but because of Othon's robotic parts, nothing could come of it. One night, during a lunar eclipse, Honorata took Othon to their room and pricked his finger with her nail telling him that he would have a child of his blood...</p><p>Nine months later Othon's servant told him that his concubines had taken Honorata to the top of the palace and were going to throw her off. He took his sons horse and rode to his armory. Loading one of his guns with a dart full of epiphyte, he ran to a ledge where he could see his concubines about to jump with his wife. As they did, Othon shot Honorata. She floated and her would-be murderers fell to their deaths. Othon got in his ship and went to pick Honorata up, but before he could she gave birth in midair. Once they were in the ship Honorata told Othon that she had given birth to a son and they named him <a data-ref-id=\"4005-46973\" href=\"/aghnar/4005-46973/\" slug=\"aghnar\">Aghnar</a>. She also told him that he could never tell anyone that Aghnar was a boy. She then revealed why.</p><p>Honorata had been sent chosen by the other priestesses of Shabda-Oud to be Othon's gift in order to seduce him and have a special child. She had planned on giving birth to a hermaphrodite so it would fulfill a prophecy saying that an androgynous being would one day rule the galaxy. It's father being the most dangerous man in existence would also add to its power. Fortunately, in her time with Othon she had genuinely fallen in love with him and so she gave him the son he had wanted.</p><p>Part of her plan had included kidnapping the child when it was 7 and delivering it to her masters, but now that she loved Othon, they had to figure out a way to protect his child. They settled on keeping the child's sex a secret for the seven years, hoping to have a proper plan by then. That night while they were sleeping, Aghnar started to float out of his crib. As soon as Othon realized that the epiphyte that had save Honorata's life had made his son weightless, he screamed in fury and took up a knife to kill his son, a boy that would never become a real warrior. Honorata was only able to stop him by revealing that the effort that she had used to have the boy had left her sterile, meaning that if he died, there would no chance for Othon to have another son. Honorata clamped weights on Aghnar's legs so he would be grounded and Othon decided to let him live, but said that he could not bear to see his son. Honorata agreed to take him away and train him for the seven years that were assured to them. At the end of that time they would return and Othon would test him to see if he was worthy, and if not, he would kill the boy and himself, ending the line of Metabarons before it started.</p><p>Seven years later, Aghnar and Honorata returned to the castle riding a winged beast and ready for the test. Othon had decided to pit his son against a robo-killer, a nearly indestructible machine with eight blade covered arms. The only way to destroy it was by avoiding the arms and setting off its self-destruct mechanism. The battle lasted for over an hour but Aghnar eventually won. Othon was displeased because Aghnar had used his flying abilities so he devised another test. He put his sons legs in a device that would squeeze them until Aghnar told it to stop. It was horrible test of strength of will and pain tolerance, but Aghnar passed, not protesting once until his legs were completely removed. After the ordeal, Othon grafted robotic legs to his sons body, finally giving him real weight and making him a Metabaron.</p><p>Soon after that, three priestesses of the Shabda-Oud arrived to inspect Othon's son. Aghnar killed all three of them but their ship was still in orbit. The thing was a cetacyborg, a creature made of flesh, magic and technology that was capable of destroying worlds. Othon took his ship to space to fight the monster ship but he found it to be indestructible. The only way he could to see to beat it was to attack from inside of it. He flew inside the beasts mouth and headed for its brain. Even that was nearly impossible though since the cetacyborg's body produced destructive acids capable of eating through his ship. By the time he reached the brain much of his ship had been eroded and he was practically drinking in the monster's acid by the mouthful. He eventually killed the beast and made it out but his lungs had been corroded and he was coughing up blood.</p><p>When Othon returned to the planet he loaded up the Metabunker and was preparing to take his family to another planet when Honorata revealed that she couldn't go with him. The Priestesses had implanted a micro-H bomb in her heart so if she ever betrayed them whatever planet she was on would be destroyed. She knew that it would soon explode but she hadn't wanted to slow Othon down so she hadn't told him about the bomb until right when he was leaving. Othon was forced to take his son and leave his wife, but he vowed to get revenge on the Shabda-Oud.       </p> <p>The Metabunker landed on the planet Perdita, a place with extreme gravity, enormous insects and floating apes. On the planet, Othon told Aghnar that he had spy-needles all over the universe that would tell him where the Shabda-Oud planet was, but it would be ten years before the signals would reach Perdita. That meant that Aghnar had ten years to prepare to face the witches of the Shabda-Oud. At that point, Othon told Aghnar that he would have to kill him. The acid in Othon's body would kill him in a few days but he wanted Aghnar to kill him before then. It would prove to Othon that Aghnar was truly worthy of being the next Metabaron. At first Aghnar refused but when Othon attacked he was forced to defend himself. Aghnar used the mental powers his mother had gifted him to paralyze his father but Othon told him that he had oko mini-bombs implanted all over his body and they would detonate if Aghnar touched him the wrong way. Aghnar reasoned that Othon couldn't have bombs in his brain if he could think properly, so he drove his weapon through his father's skull and killed him.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2><a data-ref-id=\"4005-46973\" href=\"/aghnar/4005-46973/\" slug=\"aghnar\">Aghnar</a></h2>",

He tries several times to rally fellow students in an attempt to escape, but fails. Consequently, he narrowly escapes death at the hands of his classmates on several occasions. After the death of his best friend <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61992\" href=\"/yoshitoki-kuninobu/4005-61992/\" slug=\"yoshitoki-kuninobu\"> Nobu</a>, he vows to protect his crush, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-61640\" href=\"/noriko-nakagawa/4005-61640/\" slug=\"noriko-nakagawa\">  Noriko</a>, in his stead.

  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Supreme Kai is the supreme ruler of the Eastern Quadrant of the Universe. He is short, purple skinned with white hair, dressed in a posh Kaio outfit and always accompanied by his ever-loyal bodyguard and friend, <a href=\"/kibito/4005-51163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51163\">Kibito</a>.</p><h3>Character Overview</h3><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Supreme Kai has purple skin, black eyes and a white mohawk. He wears the standard Kai outfit.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>When first introduced and during his brief match-up with Piccolo, Supreme Kai remained calm and was rather mysterious. His personality started to change after witnessing Saiyan power and the return of Majin Buu. He became more fearful, cautious and dependent on Goku and the others.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Dragon Ball Z</h3><p>East Kaioshin survived <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Majin Buu's</a> assault on the Kaioshin Kai to become the only surviving Kaioshin, when rescued by his bodyguard. East Kaioshin mentions that he was the weakest of the four kaioshins. Majin Buu proved even too powerful for his creator, the great wizard Bibidi, which forced him to seal up his destructive creation. Without Buu, the Supreme Kai was able to kill the wizard.</p><p>Afterward he is typically called only Kaioshin, since there are no others to confuse him with. He placed Buu on Earth, not knowing that Bibidi had an evil son, <a href=\"/babidi/4005-51121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51121\">Babidi</a>, with the same evil goals.</p><p>Once he learned of this, Supreme Kai and Kibito left for Earth and recruited <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Goku</a> and the other <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a> to aid them in Babidi's defeat. They were unsuccessful and Majin Buu was revived.</p><p>Supreme Kai faced Buu once again and fared no better. He and Kibito retreated to their sacred world, bringing <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> with them in the hopes he could pull the powerful <a href=\"/z-sword/4055-57105/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57105\">Z-Sword</a> from it's stone. Gohan was successful, but it turned out the sword wasn't what was powerful. The <a href=\"/elder-kai/4005-65018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65018\">Elder Kai</a> had been trapped inside. Once released, he amplified Gohan's power emmensly. He also told Supreme Kai of the Potara earrings they wore and their ability to fuse two beings together. Supreme Kai fused with Kibito, only to find out after that the <a href=\"/fusion/4015-55780/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55780\">fusion</a> was permanent.</p><p>After this, Supreme Kai was known as <a href=\"/kibito-kai/4005-82416/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82416\">Kibito Kai</a>.</p><h3>Dragon Ball Super</h3><p>When the Kais learned the <a href=\"/champa/4005-123537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-123537\">Champa</a> the God of Destruction of the Sixth Universe was hunting the <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragon Balls</a>, Kibito Kai gathered the Namekian set to safeguard them. When they learned that he was looking for a different set, Kibito Kai used the balls to wish to separate the Potara fusion. Supreme Kai and Kibito became individuals once again.</p><h3>Power</h3><p>Due to having little feats and very few fighting scenes, Supreme Kai's exact power is unknown but he stated that he is much more powerful than Frieza and that he can defea Frieza in only one blow. Piccolo also became surprised at Supreme Kai's power and stated that his power is dimensions away from his own which implies that Supreme Kai may be stronger than Piccolo but this may prove otherwise as Supreme Kai became fearful and shocked after seeing Yakon who is stronger than Frieza. Supreme Kai was able to restrain SSJ2 Gohan.</p><p> </p><p>Supreme Kai was able to fight against Fat Buu and deal some blows but that was all he could do against the monster.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Abilities</h3><p>Supreme Kai has some powerful magic abilities. He can restrain Gohan and save Gohan from getting killed by Fat Buu. </p>",

  "description": "<h2>Origin and Wildcats</h2><p>Tao was created by scientists but no one ever knew why. He was left in a base with other things like him until <a href=\"/savant/4005-21971/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21971\"> Savant</a> and <a href=\"/mr-majestic/4005-21972/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21972\"> Mr. Majestic</a> came looking for people to replace the <a href=\"/wildcats/4060-25113/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25113\"> WildC.A.T.s</a> when everyone thought they were dead. He manipulated a worker at the base to let him out so he could join the team. When he became a WildC.A.T. he started manipulating the other members into attacking enemy groups in a way that would eventually cause a <a href=\"/gang-war/4045-40664/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40664\"> Gang War</a>. When his teammates found out what he had done they tried to kill him. To escape, he tricked a shape shifter named <a href=\"/mister-white/4005-40636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40636\"> Mister White</a> into pretending he was him. Tao had gotten three members of his team hospitalized and had blown up a nuke in <a href=\"/mr-majestic/4005-21972/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21972\"> Mr. Majestic</a>'s face in his escape, so when Mr. Majestic found Tao (the shape shifted Mister White) he didn't hesitate to kill him.</p><p> </p><h2>Sleeper</h2><p>With Tao presumed dead he was able to leave and start a new life. He started <a href=\"/tao-s-criminal-organization/4060-61253/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61253\">his criminal organization</a>. He recruited <a href=\"/miss-misery/4005-4587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4587\"> Miss Misery</a>, <a href=\"/holden-carver/4005-4585/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4585\"> Holden Carver</a> and Peter Grimm to be his Prodigals. With his organization, Tao was able to meet the Inner Circle of Humanity, the secret monarchs who control the world. He became indispensable to them, going to their annual meetings, using his powers to manipulate and maneuver them into doing what he wanted. Eventually deciding he didn't like what they were doing, he turned the group to his own ends, namely destruction and chaos whenever possible. Tao's organization was eventually undone by one of his own Prodigals. Holden Carver was a double agent placed in Tao's organization by <a href=\"/john-lynch/4005-4589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4589\"> John Lynch</a>. Tao had of course figured it out and both he and Holden knew it, but Holden continued to work with him, his allegiance to IO and Lynch in question (even in his own mind). It took some time, but Holden's alignment was revealed in an event that resulted with Tao turned over to IO where he sat in a large glass tube with his tongue cut out.</p><h2>World's End</h2><p>After the events of <a href=\"/sleeper/4050-19215/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19215\">Sleeper</a> in which Tao was finally caught, there initially wasn't much known about what happened to him. It was assumed that he was still in IO custody, but it appears that was not the case. He had escaped, regenerated or regrew his tongue, came into possession of the restored <a href=\"/void/4005-12010/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12010\">Void</a>, and was making rather elaborate plans to continue his work of destroying the world. Tao's first move was to use Void to send various heroes into the future to show them a world that had been destroyed. Heroes from several prominent groups in the Wildstorm Universe saw the future but for whatever reason the actions they took on their return to the present didn't have the results that Tao wanted (or change it like they wanted). That was until <a href=\"/nemesis/4005-42464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42464\">Nemesis</a>. When she went into the future and came back she reacted in the way Tao wanted her to and in her efforts to stop the end of the world, actually started it. When last Tao was seen before World's End had begun he was already prepared. He had an army of SPBs in storage, he'd planned an uprising of another group of SPBs, he was still in possession of Void, and it appeared that he had set up a backup body with his personality in it in case anything should happen to him. After the end of the world Tao used Void to capture <a href=\"/providence/4005-42158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42158\">Providence</a>, which gave him control of two reality warpers. At first he used them subtley, expanding his abilities so he could speak directly into the brains of heroes across the planet. After that he somehow began to take their powers into himself in preparation for his next target, the reality warper known as <a href=\"/max-faraday/4005-51553/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51553\">Max Faraday</a>.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Tao's main power is his unbelievable intelligence. According to his files \"Tao's grasp of tactical, strategic thinking has achieved a seemingly transcendent level which utterly surpasses normal human consciousness. Without any recognized psionic skill such as telepathy or telekinesis, Tao's mind has entered conceptual territory so far above our own that one might as well attempt explaining quantum physics to an ant.\" Tao's brilliance usually shows itself in his ability to quickly figure out just about anything, from how to operate complex machines, how systems (social or technological) work, what the perfect strategy for any given situation is, even down to personal secrets, flaws, traits and weaknesses of people he's only just met. These kinds of information are then used in the manipulation of individuals and whole cultures for his own ends.</p><p>How he uses his intelligence on others, to manipulate and control them, is something that seems to be hypnotic or psychic, but isn't. According to scientists and people that have looked into Tao's creation (people like John Lynch), everything Tao can do comes from his intelligence. He's just so smart that somehow talking to someone, even briefly, is enough for him to completely control their way of thinking. \"He redefined genius, and listening to him talk was like playing Russian Roulette...with his words as the bullets\" - John Lynch. With nothing other than words, Tao has been able to put a superhuman in a coma, implant false memories, remove real memories, control physical actions as well as the reality that his listener experiences. In most cases though he allows his listener to retain control of their thoughts (or at least believe they do) and manipulate them in more subtle ways. Tao isn't limited to verbal communication, as shown when he had his tongue removed. He is just as dangerous with gestures and facial expressions. Any form of communication is a weapon for Tao. In addition to this, Tao is a decently skilled martial artist and has a high tolerance for pain so he's not helpless in physical combat should that ever be a last resort.</p><p> </p><p>Since Tao's ability works by controlling how someone thinks, it relies on at least some level of intelligence and as a result, it doesn't work on people who are incredibly stupid.</p><p> </p><p>After capturing Void and Providence, Tao began slowly leeching off their powers so he could control reality directly instead of working through them. The first thing he mastered was the ability to use his normal powers without his target knowing. He no longer needed to speak directly to someone, he could manipulate them from a distance (like Majestic in Hawaii or Jackson King in space) without them even knowing. He's also demonstrated superhuman reflexes, telekinesis, teleportation, transmutation (turning bullets into butterflies and turning Maul into Jeremy Stone), superhuman strength, energy manipulation and even an amazing understanding and mastery of magic.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Tao was created by <a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/travis-charest/4040-12188/\">Travis Charest</a>. His first appearance was in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wildcats-covert-action-teams/4050-6625/\">WildC.A.T.s: Covert Action Teams</a> <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wildcats-covert-action-teams-21/4000-47285/\">#21</a>.</p>",

Tiena tried to help Persha by attempting to remove the constriction placed by Ingra, but does not have the expertise to do so. She is notably jealous of the power wielded by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">Ingra</a> and wishes to one day surpass her. She eventually tries to convince Shinnsa to help her defeat <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13249\" href=\"/seahn/4005-13249/\" slug=\"seahn\">Seahn</a> after Ingra is deposed, but instead brainwashes her with a spell after Shinnsa refuses. Tiena soon teams up with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42958\" href=\"/ihroe/4005-42958/\" slug=\"ihroe\">Ihroe</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13253\" href=\"/empher/4005-13253/\" slug=\"empher\">Empher</a> in order take back control of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41581\" href=\"/house-sinister/4060-41581/\" slug=\"house-sinister\">House Sinister</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41582\" href=\"/house-dexter/4060-41582/\" slug=\"house-dexter\">House Dexter</a>, although it seems that she is thwarted when she tries to hide her secret spell in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13248\" href=\"/orium/4005-13248/\" slug=\"orium\">Orium's</a> palace. At the end of another issue, however, it turns out that this may have been part of Tiena's actual plan as she can can be seen spying on both Orium and Ihroe, stating that they performed exactly as she expected them to. Her full plan is never realized due to the abrupt cancellation of the series after the bankruptcy of Crossgen Comics. <br/><br/>Tiena's name is derived from the word patience and is the primary attribute that governs her personality. It was stated by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-42187\" href=\"/barbara-kesel/4040-42187/\" slug=\"barbara-kesel\">Barbara Kesel</a>, the series' creator, that had the series been allowed to go on as long as she wanted, Tiena's patience would have awarded her power that rivaled Ingra's.",

He said that he joined Enishi's campaign because of Nakaj\u014d's death while fighting Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai; in reality Otowa joined the fight just for pleasure <br/>\u00a0<br/>Otowa is avery sadistic man.    In his few appearances he appeared to take great joy in the pain, suffering and killing of others. His sheer cruelty extends to even  women and children, who he kills with equal glee.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>\u00a0<br/>Despite his bravado and glee of killing he is\u00a0 a bit\u00a0 of a coward as he almost retreated  from the Kamiya dojo attack after Kenshin simply glared at him. <br/></p><p>In a battle with  Yahiko in the attack on Kamiya dojo, he takes the boy lightly and while he comes close to killing Yahiko a few times thanks to his sneaky tactics the boy eventually defeats him.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>As he's defeated he has a crazed smile on his face as he could not believe he would be defeated by someone not even half his age with even less battle knowledge. He was arrested by the police afterward and never appeared again.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p><h3>Appearance</h3>\u00a0<br/>A tall thin man, who's most striking feature appears to be his love for lipstick, makeup and nail polish.\u00a0 His clothes appear very feminine as does his hair his most prominent suit trait is the\u00a0 six long piercing tentacle-like appendages worn on his torso. He appears to be a drag queen but it was never reveled if this was a lifestyle trait or if it was another of his his diversionary tactics.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><br/><h2>Skills and abilities </h2><p>\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0</p>\u00a0<b>towa Hy\u014dko</b>  is a master of assassin's weapons. His skill lay not in his skill so much as their hidden nature; he has them hidden all over his body. <p><br/>He claims to have thirteen in total yet only managed to use four during his appearances.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>The first is Baika-Chusen- a small arrow-launcher worn on his left wrist.\u00a0 This is used in tandem with a mark on his right palm, thus while the opponenet watches the right arm he attacks with the left. He has used this to great effect causing soem to think he knows magic.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The second is the Kasui Busuen- a paralyzing mist generated by dropping two small cubes into water.\u00a0 He ised this the first time he met Kenshin so he could make his escape.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The third is a jar of iron powder (Bishamonpun, 'Bishamon's Powder'), used in conjunction with his \"enchanted\" Bishamonken ('Bishamon's Sword').\u00a0 To make up for his lack of sword skills he sprays the opponent with metal powder then magnetizes the sword so the sword's edge is attracted to the opponent giving him the impression of great speed and skill.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The last is the Rokudouko- six long piercing tentacle-like appendages worn on his torso.\u00a0 If all his other techniques don't work he can spring a sneak attack with these appendages to finish them off.<br/>\u00a0<br/>His battle tactic is to outwit the opponent and catch them off guard with his hidden weapons as opposed overpowering or out fighting them with pure skill.</p><p><br/><br/></p>",

Not knowing this, <a href=\"/android-20/4005-40811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40811\">Dr. Gero</a> still created Androids <a href=\"/android-17/4005-40804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40804\">17</a> and <a href=\"/android-18/4005-40728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40728\">18</a>. Without a purpose the Androids turned on Gero and killed him then went on a Rampage killing hundreds.</p><p>But, Trunks often times found himself wondering, was it really worth it to fight and save people who would only live on in fear of torment and pain every day, or let them die in a quick, painless second? These thoughts made Trunks wonder all of the time. Luckily, he had a high drive to fight, as <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> had lost his father, the <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z-Fighters</a> were blatantly useless. Even with Trunks' father, <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>, they held no chance. All of them, <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a>, <a href=\"/krillin/4005-45683/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45683\">Krillin</a>, <a href=\"/yamcha/4005-41060/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41060\">Yamcha</a>, and <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tien</a>, were dead. Trunks had never gotten to meet them except as a baby, but even so he heard that they were all extremely great men from his sensei.</p><p>The Z-Fighters attempted to defeat them but without Goku, stood no chance and fell to the Androids power. It was a sad time for Earth in his time line. Everything they did was extremely covert as people had to live in fear every day of someone killing them from nowhere. Trunks and <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> spent everyday training, as they needed to be able to move out to take care of the Androids (or hold them off, to an extent) so that people could live another day .</p><p><a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, who understood him above all else. His mother, <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma Briefs</a>, was the only other person he had grown up knowing. They made Trunks' life all the more livable, even in these dark and dreary times.</p><p>\"Okay Trunks...\" <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> said. He and Trunks had been training for months on simply trying to get him into Super Saiyan level. It never worked...Trunks never had anything to provoke him to become saiyan . He had never lost anyone like <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> had, and only knew physical pain, nothing else.</p><p>\"OK...ummm\" Trunks said, only this training session was interrupted by a powerful shock wave heard from across the city.</p><p>\"Okay, let's go! Go! Go!\" <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> said, rushing his young purple haired student to the battle scene. Little did either of them know, this fight would change <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a> and Trunks' life forever.</p><p>About 13 years later, the Androids were still unstopped and Trunks finally went off to fight them on his own. When he arrived on scene the Androids were already gone but Gohan was there. Trunks asked Gohan to train him so he can help him defeat the murderous Androids. Gohan agreed and started training him. But before too long they met up with the Andriods. During the battle Gohan lost his arm and gained a scar on his face. This did not stop him from wanting to stop the Androids or train Trunks.</p><p>Later, the Androids struck again. This time Gohan faught them on his own and with his condition lost to them. The Androids had killed him and Trunks showed up too late. Seeing the dead body of his closest friend, it made Trunks angry enough to transform into a Super Sayian for the first time.</p><p>3 years later, Trunks' mom, Bulma, had finished the time machine she had been working on. Trunks used this time machine to go back to the past when <a href=\"/freeza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Frieza</a> was on Earth and before Goku had died. Showing up before Goku came back to Earth, Trunks easily defeated Frieza and his father, <a href=\"/king-cold/4005-45782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45782\">King Cold</a>. When Goku showed up he told him that was the son of <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma</a> from the future. He told him about how he would get sick and gave him a cure for it that was developed in the future. He also warned him about the Androids. After this Trunks returned to his own time.</p><p>Trunks later showed up to help the Z-Fighters defeat the Androids. Although when they showed up he was surprised to find that they were not the ones from his time. After defeating the Androids, Android 17, 18, and 16 were released. They easily defeated the Z-Fighters and went to find Goku. It was at this time a being called <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a> appeared. He came from another alternate future and wanted to absorb Android 17 and 18 so he could reach his perfect form. The Z-Fighters trained in the Chamber of Spirit and Time/Hyperbolic Time Chamber, so they could train for a long time but would only seem like a few hours on Earth. After this training Trunks was able to match Cell's power, even in his perfect form, although he had to change to a form that made him too slow to win.</p><p>Cell ended up defeating him but let him win so that he could warn the Z-Fighters about a tournament he was going to hold. During the tournament, Trunks was hit by one of Cell's blasts and killed but was later revived with the <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragon Balls</a>. He then returned to his time where he was powerful enough to defeat the Androids and Cell on his own.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376750\" data-ratio=\"2.3526170798898\" data-width=\"363\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 363px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:235.3%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376750\"><img alt=\"Future Trunks in Dragon Ball Super\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest 363w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376750-8194800524-latest 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" data-width=\"272\"></a><figcaption>Future Trunks in Dragon Ball Super</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dragon Ball Super</strong></p><p>Several years after killing Dabura and Babidi, and Nine years after the fall of Future Cell, a man named Goku Black goes berserk and causes humanity to be on the brink of extinction. Trunks attempts to stop Black, but fails. Bulma suggests that they should receive help from Goku and Vegeta in the past. Six months later, Bulma gathers enough fuel for a one-way trip to the past for the Time Machine, when all of a sudden, Black gets in their way. Future Trunks shields his mother when Black destroys the lab. Future Trunks is shocked to see that Black has Future Bulma. Future Bulma then tells him to go on without her, and that getting back to the past is the highest priority. Black then fires another ki blast, destroying the lab and Future Bulma as Future Trunks watches in horror. He then shakes it off and runs to find Future Mai, knowing that getting back to the past is their highest priority.</p><p>Future Trunks goes to search for Future Mai, and he is concerned at first when he knocks at her door and gets no answer, yet is relieved when he sees her. Mai asks where Bulma is, then is saddened when she realizes that Black must have killed her, and Future Trunks then confirms this by saying that in order to escape, she sacrificed herself as Black killed her, and mourns her death as he cries over his loss. Future Trunks reignites the hope of going back to the past as he shows Mai the energy that Bulma sacrificed her life to get, further stating they can go back to the past. Trunks and Mai are seen in the room. Mai asks him if he wants to rest, yet he declines. Mai offers him some meat, and as he is about to eat it, he sees a small kitten leap onto the floor, and smiles at the kitten. He asks Mai if the kitten will be alright, and she says it will, since many kittens apparently forget the face of their owner in 3 days. Trunks then offers half of the can of meat to Mai, and she at first refuses, yet realizes how hungry she is and eats it rather quickly. After she finishes eating, Trunks tells her that they only have enough energy to make a one way trip. Mai asks how they will return back to their timeline, and he responds by saying they will find a way. They then prepare to leave to Capsule Corporation, and they both see the kitten leave, and that puts a smile on their face, and they run to Capsule Corporation.</p><p>As they both are near Capsule Corporation, Mai asks if Trunks can sense Blacks energy, and he says he cannot. When they are at the door of the Capsule Corporation building, Trunks looks back and sees that Black has appeared again. He attempts to fight Black and unsheathes his sword, managing to deflect a few of his ki attacks with it, however Black easily knocks his sword away with a punch, also throwing him to the ground. Mai runs to Future Trunks, where he yells at her for not escaping when she had the chance, and Mai tells him she will act as a decoy so he can escape. He then watches as she shoots at Black with her shotgun and is thrown away like a rag doll from one of Black's ki attacks and seemingly killed. Trunks then runs to Mai to see if she is alright, and gets filled with anger as he holds her in his hands, then looks to Black, who has taken his human form, boasting how Trunks will breathe his last breathe as he looks with a smirk on his face. Enraged Trunks powers up to Super Saiyan and launches a all out assault on Black, actually catching him off guard and causing some damage to Black however Black was quick to regain the upper hand and swats Trunks away and attacks. As a Super Saiyan Trunks was able to hold his own for some time but eventually was overwhelmed and dropkicked into a wall and blasted with a barrage of Ki Blasts. While Black prepared for the kill with a Giant Golden-Black Ki Blast Trunks throws his sword at the attack, causing it to detonate in Black's face and follows up with a Masenko which Black blocks.</p><p>Future Trunks manages to escape from Black and get the time machine 17 years into the past traveling from Age 797 to Age 780, where his time machine is found by a woman and he's found inside by Present Trunks. He is then rushed onto a gurney, where Trunks gets to see him, and is shocked by Future Trunks' arrival. He is then with Bulma, Vegeta, Goku, and Trunks, where they see him and are all in concern. Trunks eventually wakes up. Upon seeing Goku, he has flashbacks showing the death of Future Bulma and Future Mai. He then mistakes Goku for Goku Black and attempts to attack Goku in anger, much to Goku's confusion. However, Goku halts Trunks' attack by grabbing his arm before the attack can hit. However Future Trunks is able to see with Bulma's help that Goku isn't his enemy and Trunks calms down and explains what happened. Goku, curious to how strong Future Trunks is, asks to have a sparring match with Future Trunks. Future Trunks accepts and powers up to Super Saiyan 2. Impressed, Goku also powers up to Super Saiyan 2 and then eventually goes farther to Super Saiyan 3. Bulma, fearing for the city, erects a barrier around them so they can fight in peace. Fully powered up, Future Trunks, as a Super Saiyan 2 attacks with his sword. The force from the blow shatters the barrier but Goku as a Super Saiyan 3 caught the blade without much effort then proceeded to overpower the young Saiyan. Goku helps Trunks to his feet and tells him that he is impressed with his power and is amazed that he was able to get so far on his own.</p><p>Future Trunks is then greeted by Krillin and Piccolo, who ask if something happened in the future. Then, a sudden thunderstorm appears, and Goku Black appears through a portal, which shocks Future Trunks. Future Trunks becomes enraged by Black's appearance in the past he is ready to fight but is stopped by Vegeta. He watches the fight between Super Saiyan 2 Goku vs Black and he wonders why Goku doesn't go all out. When the fight ends, Black is sucked back into the future, but not before Black destroys the Time Machine. With the Time Machine destroyed, Future Trunks is stranded in the past with no way back to Future Earth. He then learns about the Time Ring from Whis and Beerus and asks for one but Beerus tells him that The Time Ring can only be used by the Supreme Kai. Bulma then found a capsule and opens it revealing, the Time Machine that Cell came in from the Future. Bulma revealed that before Future Trunks went back to the future after Cell's defeat he gave that capsule to Bulma she could never figure it out so she put it away and forgot all about it. Now that she has her future self's notebook she can fix it and make it work.</p><p>Future Trunks then meets present day Mai and tells her about her future counterpart. He tells her about how her future counterpart and how she was leader of the resistance against Goku Black. Goku then interrupts the story saying that Future Trunks should rest since he's been pushing himself ever since he got to the present timeline. Future Trunks then takes a nap, but has a nightmare about Black so he wakes up and checks on the progress of the Time Machine, and Bulma says she already has the fuel for the Time Machine, much to Future Trunks' surprise. He then goes outside where Piccolo and Krillin are cleaning up the mess from the battle and asks them where Gohan is, thinking maybe he should take Gohan to the future as well. Piccolo says that's a bad idea because Gohan is not as strong as he used to be, and told Future Trunks he \"wasn't the same Gohan he knew\".</p><p>Future Trunks then visits Gohan during his conference, and they have ice cream together, while Future Trunks is somewhat shocked and slightly disappointed with Gohan's current power, and feels like he can't recognize him at all. Gohan invites him to meet his family, and they travel to Gohan's house, where Future Trunks meets Videl, Mr. Satan and Gohan's daughter, Pan. While Future Trunks waits for Gohan to finish his work, and Videl to prepare dinner, he babysits Pan, and wonders why is he there doing nothing, and Pan begins a tug-of-war with Trunks over his sword, until Gohan arrives to stop Pan. Future Trunks and Gohan then go outside with Pan, and they begin to talk about how Gohan should be stricter with Pan, but can't help himself as he gets \"soft\" whenever he looks at her. After Future Trunks sees Gohan playing with Pan, he has a vision of how his future would've been if Black hadn't shown up, and realizes the reason why he has to fight Black; in order to allow the people of his future to live happily like Gohan and his family, and is finally able to lighten up after the traumatic events he witnessed. Upon arrival back at Capsule Corp Trunks bumps into Krillin and talks for awhile and Krillin wants to introduce Trunks to his wife and kid to which Trunks is excited to mert. Upon seeing 18 Trunks prepares to draw his sword but Krillin stops him and says that 18 is his wife, much to Trunks shock and 18 reveals she even has a kid with Krillin which shocks Trunks more. After clearing things up with Trunks 18 rejoins Krillin and there daughter.</p><p>The next day Vegeta takes Trunks to the forest to train and Trunks powers up to Super Saiyan 2 and wants Vegeta to go Super Saiyan 3 like Goku. Vegeta only laughs and goes Super Saiyan Blue, which confuses Trunks initially but Trunks is quickly able to figure out what Super Saiyan Blue is and also figures out Goku can do this form as well and believes that Black can easily be stopped if Goku and Vegeta fight him together as Super Saiyan Blue's. Vegeta begins to mock Trunks and says let's make it a game and Vegeta says if Trunks can hit him once Vegeta will forfeit the match to Trunks. Trunks responds by transforming into Super Saiyan Third Grade while Super Saiyan 2 for a massive power boost which Vegeta mocks and calls a primitive transformation and charges Trunks rapidly moving around him trying to confuse him. However Trunks is able to follow his father and at the last moment power back down to Super Saiyan 2 and counter attacks and begins to actually push back Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta with Vegeta realizing Trunks lured him in with the form. Vegeta is quickly able to regain the upper hand and begins to attack, with Trunks able to hold his own for a time but is eventually kicked through the forest and into a cliff as Goku and Bulma arrive via Instant Transmission. Trunks appears to have been beaten and power back down to base form, with Vegeta lifts Trunks by his shirt and begins mocking Trunks more and telling him that his goal should be to become the strongest in the universe and not just beat Black. Bulma attempts to move in to stop Vegeta but Goku stops her and says it's not over yet. Vegeta lowers his guard thinking he has won but Trunks springs to life and reveals he isn't hurt at all and headbutts Vegeta to the ground. Trunks begins to laugh at Vegeta and proclaim his victory over him and offers to help him up but Vegeta refuses and storms off. Trunks bows to his father and vows once again to not only defeat Black but to surpass him.</p><p> </p><h2>Equipment</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376848\" data-ratio=\"1.64\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:164.0%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376848\"><img alt=\"Future Trunks wielding his Sword\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" data-width=\"390\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 450w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 390w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Future Trunks wielding his Sword\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 450w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11128/111283887/5376848-2873938004-latest 390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" data-width=\"390\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Future Trunks wielding his Sword</figcaption></figure><p><b>Sword: </b>Trunks has a sword which he is very skilled with and without. With his sword Trunks has killed Mecha Frezia. Trunk's sword was forged by a master swordsmith. Trunk's sword is eventualy destroyed in an intense battle. However, in <i>Super</i> he now has a new sword that is different from his first one. The new long-sword weapon has an olive-green leather hilt with a silver hand-guard with the ends curving upwards. The scabbard is red, and the strap that goes across the chest is the same olive-green color as the hilt.</p><p><strong>Senzu Beans:</strong> Trunks uses Senzu Beans to heal any and all physical injurys even if they are fatal. A Senzu Bean has been usesed to heal Goku from a fatal attack after he was shot through the heart by a laser blaster.</p><h2>Techniques</h2><p><strong>Burning Attack: </strong>This is Trunks signature move Trunks moves he does a series of fast arm movements then places his hands toghther and fires a giant ki blast that looks like a fireball it expoldes on impact.</p><p><strong>God Breaker: </strong>A giant yellow ki wave that Trunks uses to kill King Cold.</p><p><strong>Super Buster Canon: </strong>The move Trunks uses against Vegeta to stop him from helping Cell reach his perfect form by absorbing Android 18. Trunks charges up a giant ball of energy in his hands and fires a laser beam from this ball.</p><p><strong>Burning Slash: </strong>Trunks fires a Burning Attack slow enough so the enemy will dodge by flying up then Trunks appears slashing the enemy into tiny pices before shoting them with a ki blast to incinerating them. Trunks used this move to kill Mecha Frezia.</p><p><strong>Heat Dome Attack: </strong>Trunks surrounds himself in a dome of ki energy and blasts the opponent with a fiery attack. This attack incinerates most enemies like Cell when he was killed while charging a kamehamaha blast.</p><p><strong>Masenko: </strong>Due to being trained by Future Gohan, Trunks is able to use the Masenko as a move. He lifts his arms up, powers a yellow blast, and fires it at his opponent. He used this technique in his fight with Broly and at Super against Goku Black.</p><p><strong>Change The Future: </strong>Trunks dashes towards his opponent and destroys them with a powerful blast with quick speed. He used this attack to destroy 18.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong>: Trunks' Saiyan/Hybrid physiology grants him greater superhuman physical strength than the average Saiyan. Trunks has several notable feats of physical strength such as overpowering and overwhelming Android 17 and Android 18, effortlessly stopping a car with his leg as a child, shattering mountain-like rock formations with his fists, physically overpowering beings more powerful than a Super Saiyan and easily overwhelming Imperfect Cell with physical strength alone, he has been seen easily lifting Frieza's Supernova energy ball which is a very heavy and dense ball of energy with enough mass to destroy a planet with a single arm showing no sign of physical effort. In <em>Super</em>, Future Trunks became much stronger thanks to his continuous training ad was able to defeat Dabura as a Super Saiyan, whose power was said to be even greater than Super Perfect Cell. In his Super Saiyan form, Trunks is able to knock back Goku Black and hold his own against him for some time. Also, Super Saiyan 2 Future Trunks was shown to fight on par with Super Saiyan 2 Goku. As a Super Saiyan, Trunks can lift in the excess of 40 tons as Super Saiyan Goku was able to move at lightning fast speeds with 40 tons of weight attached to his body and in his Ascended Super Saiyan and Ultra Super Saiyan form he is able to lift far in the excess of 100 tons making him one of the physically strongest Saiyans ever mentioned and seen in all of Dragon Ball Z. As a Super Saiyan Trunks killed King Cold who was stronger than Mecha Frezia in hand to hand combat (no sword).</p><p><strong>Superhuman Speed</strong>: Like all Saiyans, Trunks' superhuman physiology grants him great superhuman speed. Trunks thinks, reacts and moves at superhuman speeds. Trunks has easily dodged high caliber bullets being fired by a machine gun, Trunks is able to conduct complicated plans in seconds or minutes and is able to analyze complicated puzzles and knows how to build and use advanced futuristic machinery and devices. Through intense physical training Trunks is able to further increase his speed and is functionally able to fly in the excess of the speed of sound which is roughly 770 mph however it should be noted that when Trunks trasnforms into an Ascended Super Saiyan his speed increases. As an Ultra Super Saiyan his speed is greatly decreased and sacrificed so that he may increase his physical power. Trunks is able to dodge lightning fast attacks that cannot be seen by the human eye. As a Super Saiyan 2, Trunks increases his speed even further than ever before.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Durability</strong>: Trunks is a a half Saiyan/half Human hybrid which grants him great durability, greater than that of regular Saiyans. Trunks' body like all Saiyans' bodies is composed of super-dense tissue and is able to withstand high caliber bullets without sustaining physical damage, as a teenager he was able to withstand blows from the Androids, Trunks is able to withstand falls from high altitudes and being smashed through hard rocky formations without sustaining any visible physical damage and he is able to survive extremely powerful energy blasts and energy waves without sustaining any visible physical damage.</p><p><strong>Energy Manipulation</strong>: Trunks has the natural ability that all Saiyans have to manipulate energy for various purposes such as energy blasts, energy balls, energy waves, energy shields, energy bolts, explosive energy waves etc. Trunks has been shown creating colossal energy blasts that overwhelm the likes of the Androids and even Perfect Cell and was able to effortlessly incinerate Imperfect Cell with a colossal energy blast. Trunks' most powerful blast is the energy blast he performs during his Shining Sword attack and his most powerful and colossal energy blast is the blast he performs during his Heat Dome attack that easily incinerated Imperfect Cell. Trunks can also create and generate incredibly powerful and colossal energy balls such as his Burning Attack energy ball and his Buster Cannon energy ball which both can destroy the planets. Trunks can also launch a scattered array of energy bolts at his opponents and can manipulate energy to create strong energy shields to protect him from powerful attacks. Trunks commonly manipulates ki energy and can gather the ki energy from his environment and use it to enhance and or increase and or augment his power, when he begins gathering energy a flame-like aura of any color forms around his body and it begins to rapidly shift as he increases his power. Trunks can channel ki energy through his body to enhance or increase his physical power and can also concentrate ki energy into single areas of his body such as fists to deliver more powerful and harder punches and this attack is called an \"Energy-Enhanced Strike\".</p><p><strong>Energy Constructs</strong>: Trunks is able to manipulate energy to create solid energy constructs that are extremely hard and can be used to deliver immensely powerful blows that unleash great concussive force.</p><p><strong>Ki Sense</strong>: Trunks is able to sense the ki energy of other beings and follow the energy trail the ki energy of the being leaves behind and uses this ability to locate other beings or sense their presence.

Trunks first transformed into this form after witnessing his master Gohan's death at the hands of the Androids which caused his rage to surface. When Trunks transforms into a Super Saiyan his appearance changes dramatically as his eyes turn into a bright emerald green color, his hair turns golden and stands on end, becomes sraighter and spikier and longer, his skin tone becomes lighter, his facial expression sharpens, he becomes slightly more muscular and a flame-like golden aura is formed around his body. Trunks' power increases dramatically and his power increases 50x his normal power level and his speed is also greatly increased however even with the immense increase in power he stills maintains his sincere and serious demeanor. After entering The Hyberbolic Time Chamber a second time Trunks mastered the Super Saiyan form making him a Full Powered Super Saiyan. As a Full Powered Super Saiyan Trunk's hair is a lighter gold he has no gold aura unless he powers up. As a Full Powered Super Saiyan Trunks is stronger than both Android 17 and Android 18 as he easily kills them both after returning to his own time. He then goes on to kill imperfect Cell. Trunks also masters this form as a kid. As a Super Saiyan Trunks is said to be less powerful than Vegeta but it's later revealed that he was holding back and is more powerful than Vegeta as a Super Saiyan.</p><h3>Super Saiyan 2nd Grade:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3368360-pdvd_048.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3368360-pdvd_048.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3368360-pdvd_048.png\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/3368360-pdvd_048.png\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Trunks achieved this form after he and Vegeta suffered defeat at the hands of Android 17 and Android 18 the two underwent intense training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. In this form Trunks' power and speed are greatly elevated and his physical strength is greatly increased. Trunks' appearance changes slightly, his muscles swell causing his body to become several times his size and his muscles increase greatly and he becomes bulkier, his hair grows slightly longer and becomes spikier and sharper he has only one bang not his regular like Super Saiyan and his skin tone becomes slightly lighter.

This is another form achieved by Trunks during his training session with Vegeta in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. In this form Trunks' muscles become abnormally large and swell even more than in his Super Saiyan 2nd Grade form, he becomes bigger in size due to immense muscle mass increase, his hair become slightly longer and spikier from his previous form and his aura becomes spikier. In this form Trunks is at his most powerful and physically strongest however this form has great lack of speed and mobility giving Trunks a great disadvantage in battle as this form requires too much time in ki and energy consumption and cannot maintain this form for long periods due to that fact. In this form he was vastly physically stronger than Perfect Cell but lost because of extreme lack of speed. Trunks doesn't have this form as a kid.</p><h3>Super Saiyan 2:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376795\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376795\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 1920w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 1920w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376795-4806596665-latest 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>While Future Trunks is first seen with this transformation in video-games, it is confirmed in Dragon Ball Super anime that he is able to transform into it.

In video-games, Future Trunks' hair is spikier and straighter up, however in the anime, his hair retains the same overall style though slightly spikier and losing the thin bangs of hair close to his forehead, though this could be an animation mistake and may be fixed in the DVD Release of Dragon Ball Super.</p><h3>Super Saiyan 2 Third Grade:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376810\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5376810\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" data-srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 1024w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111283887/5376810-8345100623-latest 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>This form, identical to Ultra Super Saiyan though as a Super Saiyan 2, makes a brief appearance in Dragon Ball Super, used by Future Trunks in his sparring match with Vegeta.

  "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The first Turtle makes his debut in All-Flash #21 against <a href=\"/jay-garrick/4005-2395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2395\">Jay Garrick</a>, the Golden Age <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a>. The Turtle was a slow-talking, slow moving criminal who decided that, ironically, moving slowly was the way to cope with the super-speed of the Flash. The Turtle believed that the Flash was unable to slow down, turn or stop quickly once he was running at super-speed. He tried to take advantage of this presumed liability in committing his crimes. Nonetheless, the Flash succeeded in capturing the Turtle. Later, the Turtle adopted a turtle-like costume which he wore when battling the Flash.</p><p>In Showcase #4, the debut of <a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Barry Allen</a>, the Silver Age Flash, is also the debut of the second Turtle and Allen's first foe. This criminal originally dressed normally and called himself the Turtle Man. He based his slowness trademark in committing crimes on his own slow movements and speech. Once, he robbed a bank in <a href=\"/central-city/4020-54995/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54995\">Central City</a> and people searched outside the bank for him, assuming he had fled the scene. He hid inside the bank and slowly made his escape once the coast was clear. However, on this same occasion, he had the misfortune of being captured by the Flash.</p><p>After being paroled from jail, the Turtle Man inherited a fortune. He used this fortune to devise and construct advanced technology which he has employed in subsequent crimes. He changed his alias to the Turtle and wears a costume resembling a turtle shell. He didn't have a need for money but stole for the excitement with the Flash as an opponent.</p><p>In recent years, the first Turtle returns with the second Turtle as his ally in an attempt to take over <a href=\"/keystone-city/4020-40924/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40924\">Keystone City</a> from underground. A lab accident critically injures the second Turtle, appearing to cripple him. Later, <a href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Wally West</a>, the third Flash, and his allies find the Turtles' underground headquarters which results in a battle that destroys the headquarters. The first Turtle is seemingly killed while the second Turtle is taken into custody.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Secret of Barry Allen</h3><p>For more information see: <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-flash-213-slow-motion/4000-131551/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-131551\">The Flash #213 - Slow Motion</a></p><p>When Superman and Wally West raced past <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/iron-heights/4020-41410/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41410\">Iron Heights</a>, there super speed gave Turtle the \"jump start\" he needed and he learned how to steal other objects kinetic energy. He soon escapes Iron Heights and goes for a stroll through downtown Central City, stealing every things kinetic energy making it appear time has stopped. It doesn't take long before Wally finds him and the two fight. Turtle reveals he can steal the energy and give it back forcing Wally to speed up uncontrollably.</p><p>Wally soon defeats Turtle by trapping him under tar, and returns the villain to Iron Heights.</p><h2>Equipment and Paraphernalia</h2><p>The Turtle is so slow-moving and out of condition that he is an extremely poor hand-to-hand combatant. The first Turtle is a good but not brilliant criminal strategist, while the second Turtle has considerable talent as an inventor of advanced technology. The second Turtle wears a device that enables him to project a force field around him which can stop bullets. He calls this his invisible brake shield.</p><p>The shell he wears as part of his costume serves as body armor and can expand to cover and protect his head. It also contains jets which he can activate to fire the entire shell at an enemy as a large projectile. He also has a ray device that causes people to move slowly and a slow laser device that affects a victim's optic nerves so that things will seem to move at super-speed.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Justice League Unlimited</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26877/518837-turtle_man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-518837\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.202479338843\" data-width=\"242\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 242px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26877/518837-turtle_man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-518837\"><img alt=\" Turtle in Justice League Unlimited. \" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26877/518837-turtle_man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26877/518837-turtle_man.jpg 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" data-width=\"242\"></a><figcaption> Turtle in Justice League Unlimited. </figcaption></figure><p>Turtle appears in Justice League Unlimited episode ''Flash and Substance'' entering a bar before <a href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Flash's</a> enemies attack the <a href=\"/flash-museum/4020-50067/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50067\">Flash Museum.</a> In this episode, a statue of Turtle can also be seen in the background during the battle.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The Flash</h3><p>The Turtle appears in The Flash as a villain that not even Barry Allen was aware of.

After falling into a vat of amino acids from one of his own experiments, Sven turned into Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man with the power to turn into any animal, including <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56551\" href=\"/dinosaurs/4060-56551/\">    dinosaurs</a>, vegetable, including trees and growing vines, and mineral, including diamond. He used said powers to take revenge on the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-5701\" href=\"/doom-patrol/4060-5701/\">         Doom Patrol</a>, but the Doom Patrol won, took away his powers and sent him to jail. Somehow, Sven's powers returned and he attacked the Doom Patrol time and time again. More than once he was defeated by his anti-decay ray. He was then broken out of jail by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-25155\" href=\"/general-immortus/4005-25155/\">         General Immortus</a> and together they took on the new Doom Patrol and was defeated when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30558\" href=\"/celsius/4005-30558/\">         Celsius</a> encased him in a block of ice. <br />\u00a0<br />Sven was not seen for many years afterward. When the original Doom Patrol reunited and relocated to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56600\" href=\"/oolong-island/4020-56600/\">    Oolong Island</a>, Sven was cornered by police in a diner, creating a hostage situation. Originally not wanting to create a dangerous situation, he was goaded into it by pushy police. In the end, he let the hostages go before transforming and killing the police. After this, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4095\" href=\"/thayer-jost/4005-4095/\">        Thayer Jost</a> sent a limousine for him. After meeting with Jost, Sven was welcomed into Jost's corporate team, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58240\" href=\"/front-men/4060-58240/\">  Front Men</a>. His first mission was to assassinate former Doom Patrol member <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3586\" href=\"/beast-boy/4005-3586/\">       Beast Boy</a>, foster son of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4088\" href=\"/elasti-girl/4005-4088/\">      Elasti-Girl</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-14647\" href=\"/mento/4005-14647/\">     Mento</a>. Ultimately, after arriving at <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55705\" href=\"/titans-tower/4020-55705/\">    Titans Tower</a> in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\" href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\">    San Francisco</a>, he was told to fall back to Jost Enterprises. The Doom Patrol had infiltrated it to retrieve the captured Elasti-Girl. In the ensuing brawl, Sven cut Elasti-Girl down the middle, revealing that she was no longer human, but sentient protoplasm instead. Like the rest of the Front Men, Sven retreated in the end, making the Doom Patrol look as if they attacked without provocation. <br /></p>",

Born of a demon father, and human mother, his mother never survived the birth. After centuries, Violator would kill his father and proclaiming himself leader of the Phlebiac brothers.</p><p>The Clown is The Violator's alter ego. his \"secret Identity. He uses this guise to walk peacefuly among humans. this form is a midget, obese, and ugly with a blue mark on his face in the shape of an \"M\". Although Violator has shapeshifting powers and can take any appearence he'd like, he uses this form because he sees humans as pathetic and disgusting as his clown form.</p><h2>Hellspawn Past and Present</h2><p>The Violator was sent to Earth in order to train the newest Hellspawn, Al Simmons currently known as <a href=\"/spawn/4005-3381/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3381\">Spawn</a>, however Violator went on a killing spree in an attempt to get the mafia on Spawn, this worked but the deaths caused crime to be lowered through the whole city, later during his battle with Spawn, Malebolgia grew angry at him for his actions and locked him in his Clown form.</p><p>During his time in this form he revealed his past to 3 kids telling them a twisted version of his battle with the <a href=\"/medieval-spawn/4005-49087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49087\">Medieval Spawn</a>. He kidnapped his wife and during the ensuing battle Violator was decapitated but his mission was considered a success since he had driven away the Hellspawn's only love. As a reward Malebolgia revived his body. Soon after finishing his story he found out that Spawn had been blamed for his murders, angered now that there was no use of it he went to show <a href=\"/tony-twist/4005-25127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25127\">Tony Twist</a> and the mafia to show them who really committed the murders.</p><h2>Violator Mini-series</h2><p>After finding out Spawn had been blamed for the murders of the city's mafia leaders he decide to show them the truth. But without his demon form, he knew it would be impossible so he made a deal with Spawn to borrow some of his power and bring it back after he got what he needed. Once he began murdering mafia members Tony Twist retaliated and sent out a hitman by the name of the Actualizer. As the Phlebiac brothers watched, they grew embarrassed and angry with Violator. They step in, but the Actualizer holds them at bay with an arsenal that could flatten an army. During this, they set up a magical dome around the mall in which the conflict is taking place. in the ensuing battle, Violator escapes, and finds Spawn. Violator begs Spawn to borrow his powers, and he agrees. He then returns to the battle, beats his brothers and meets again with Tony Twist, but mistakes him for one of Twist's men, and vice-versa. Violator says \"All humans look alike\". Violator dresses up Tony Twist's henchman as a clown, and the Phlebiac brothers take the decoy, and return to hell. He returns to Spawn and gives the powers he borrowed back, keeping his word.</p><h2>Violator Vs Badrock</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107619/2334485-vvb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2334485\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5401015228426\" data-width=\"985\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 985px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107619/2334485-vvb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2334485\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/107619/2334485-vvb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107619/2334485-vvb.jpg 985w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/107619/2334485-vvb.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/107619/2334485-vvb.jpg 623w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" data-width=\"623\"></a></figure><p>After the events in the <a href=\"/violator/4050-5443/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5443\">Violator mini-series</a> The <a href=\"/the-phlebiac-brothers/4060-48927/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48927\">Phlebiac Brothers</a> open a portal to Hell, and an obscure science-research agency employs <a href=\"/badrock/4005-5187/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5187\">Badrock</a>, The Youngblood, to capture The <a href=\"/violator/4005-3390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3390\">Violator</a>, in hopes of finding a way into Hell for acquisition. Little do they know, however, that they have attracted the attention of the other side of the war. The Angel <a href=\"/celestine/4005-7354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7354\">Celestine</a> has ventured upon the science grounds, and wreaks havok in order to kill the demon Violator. With <a href=\"/celestine/4005-7354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7354\">Celestine</a> rampaging through the Parsons Institute of research, <a href=\"/badrock/4005-5187/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5187\">Badrock</a> has no choice but to free and ask help from <a href=\"/violator/4005-3390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3390\">Violator</a>. When Celestine shows to face him, he frames Badrock to be the demon she is seeking, and in the midst of the ensuing fight, Violator lands a fatal blow to the Angel. However, Celestine does not die in vain, and using her remaining powers, she opens a wormhole that transports the entire Science facility, and everyone inside to <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell</a>. With the Parsons institute in <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell</a>, <a href=\"/badrock/4005-5187/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5187\">Badrock</a> is finding it a hassle to fend off the demons from Hell. Then <a href=\"/violator/4005-3390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3390\">Violator</a> happened to have been teleported to Hell along with everyone else. while at each other's throat, Violator and Badrock are met by the <a href=\"/the-phlebiac-brothers/4060-48927/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48927\">Phlebiac Brothers</a>: Vacillator, Vandalizer, Vaporizer and Victimizer. Violator escapes during the battle, leaving Badrock to fend for himself. Badrock then manages to distract them with other matters, and when he returns to the institute, Dr. Mcalistar is gone, and the angle holding them in Hell is beginning to fade out of energy. With the Angel <a href=\"/celestine/4005-7354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7354\">Celestine</a> losing her hold on the Parsons institute, <a href=\"/badrock/4005-5187/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5187\">Badrock</a> has to now go in search of Dr. Macalistar. Badrock suits up, and takes the Dimensional sphere with him on his travel, as to lure <a href=\"/violator/4005-3390/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3390\">Violator</a> away from innocents inside the building, which in turn will lure the Phlebiac Brothers. The ruse works, and Badrcok finds Dr. Macalistar, but briefly battles Violator. Violator is winning the battle, but the <a href=\"/the-phlebiac-brothers/4060-48927/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48927\">Phlebiacs</a> intervene. This gives Badrcok enough time to get the Doctor back to the institute. As they get back the Angel is slowly fading away, but Violator is back, seemingly having beaten his demon brothers, he now crushes Badrock. Badrock manages to get Celestine's holy lance, however, and shoots violator, pushing him out of the institute and leaving him in <a href=\"/hell/4020-42471/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42471\">Hell</a>. Violator now has to deal with his angry brothers once again, and the Institute, and everyone in it are safe.</p><h2>The Game</h2><p>After getting back his powers Violator set a trap for Spawn and used a lackey named Rat to trick Spawn. When Rat found Spawn he knew his real name, angered Spawn followed him, however just before he reached him Violator killed Rat by ripping his heart out. When Spawn found him Violator dragged Spawn down to the sewers below where a fierce battle ensued. During the fight a pipe ruptured and sent both of them to different parts of the sewer, it was then that <a href=\"/the-freak/4005-23669/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23669\">The Freak</a> pulled the Violator out of the water and ran of. Then Violator came up with a new plan and sought the help of <a href=\"/jason-wynn/4005-3391/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3391\">Jason Wynn</a>. He used his powers to get to Jason and get to Spawn's family. soon he started stalking <a href=\"/cyan/4005-23405/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23405\">Cyan</a> and framed Spawn by taking his form and letting <a href=\"/wanda-fitzgerald/4005-3394/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3394\">Wanda Fitzgerald</a> catch him in the act of kidnapping her. The plan however backfire horribly as Spawn found the Violator and destroyed him while he was still in his Clown form.</p><h2>In Hell</h2><p>Although Spawn had destroyed him in his human form <a href=\"/cogliostro/4005-23462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23462\">Cogliostro</a> revealed to Spawn that the only way to truly kill a demon was to cut off it's head in its true demonic form. It was then that <a href=\"/mammon/4005-3384/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3384\">Mammon</a> began using Violator to torment Cyan during Spawn's battle with <a href=\"/urizen/4005-46531/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46531\">Urizen</a>. Then during Spawn's return to Hell to gain control of <a href=\"/the-eighth-sphere-of-hell/4020-49825/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-49825\">The Eighth Sphere of Hell</a>. While in Hell it would appear that Violator has great power, and can morph body parts into weaponry, such as a mace, hammer, or even just extend his claws... but the outcome to it all is that he faced off with Spawn and Spawn successful defeated the Violator yet again. This however was not the last that would be seen of him.....</p><h2>Return to Earth</h2><p>After Spawn had stopped The Kingdom by using the demons <a href=\"/ab/4005-49990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49990\">Ab</a> and <a href=\"/zab/4005-49991/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49991\">Zab</a> to create a portal to Hell, Mammon ordered Violator to return via the portal to wreak havoc on Spawn's life. Once there he found that Spawn had forced Jason Wynn to go insane and so he appeared to him as a ghostly apparition and helped him pull himself together eventually helping him get his job back in the NSA. However after Jason returned to the top he control over Jason's psyche and took advantage at a time when Wynn was about to fall to his death, he forced him to fall and possessed his body using it as his new vessel.</p><h2>A Thousand Clowns</h2><p>After taking control of Jason he transformed his body bloating him and growing fans and put his blue face paint on Wynn's face. The Violator then began to \"mark\" the citizens of the city and turning them all into blue faced clowns just like Jason Wynn. He possessed them and forced them to tear apart the city and commit crimes and vandalism but when Spawn went to stop him, Violator fought and beat him nearly to death, but instead of killing him he left Spawn in the alleys of New York in his regular Al Simmons persona entrapping him within the Dead-Zone. He then used him as an attraction for the circus his brothers had turned the all of New York into... \"\"The Phlebiac Brothers' Pandemonium Circus.\" When he woke up however he was somehow outside of the Dead-Zone and attempted to defeat the Violator only to be beaten again, knowing he couldn't defeat the Violator, Spawn turned to fighting the clowns and protecting the citizens of the city, but when the people turned against him his grenades went off and left Spawn unconscious and suddenly Violators attack stopped. Violator supposedly left Jason Wynn's body and Violator was now free to wander the Earth with no strings attached.</p><h2>Barney Saunders</h2><p>With his spirit now free to do as it wished, Violator reappeared in a new taller, skinnier body. The Violator had saved the life of a man named Barney Saunders who had been trapped in a garbage chute who would have been eaten alive by rats and roaches had it not been for Violator's presence. Barney Saunders was the lover of a married woman named Wilma Barbera. Trying to escape discovery by Wilma Barbera's husband, Barney Saunders jumped down the garbage chute only to be trapped there a couple of days before the Bright Light event (Spawn's destruction and recreation of the world). Violator saving him however was no act of charity as he possessed Barney's body and utilized it as his own. Now after gaining his new body he released the inhibitions of the residents of an apartment complex forcing to commit horrific murders and acts of crime and violence. This allowed him to create a portal to Hell for his brothers to enter Earth through. During the murders <a href=\"/sam-burke/4005-3387/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3387\">Sam Burke</a> and <a href=\"/twitch-williams/4005-3388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3388\">Twitch Williams</a> encountered Violator as they investigated the scene. When Spawn learned of thess events via Sam and Twitch he fought Violator only to be defeated. Just as Violator was about to bring his brothers through the portal Barney's lover Wilma Barbera appeared, his love for her allowed him to gain control again. Not wanting to let the demons through he closed the portal himself by going through it and closing it but not before taking Wilma with since he was angry that she had left him in the chute. After going through the portal it closed and left Violator, Wilma, and Barney stranded in Hell.</p><ol><li><strong>Endgame</strong></li><li>After the suicide of Al Simmons, Violator returned to find the headless body of Simmons. Confused at first, Violator realized now is his chance to become a true leader, to begin a new Unholy Trinity. Violator later tempts the new Spawn into corruption, for this will also fall to his plans. Violator also gains the help of Vampires. But for Violator's plan to work, both Al Simmons AND Malebolgia must be dead... and later in issue #200 it is revealed that Malebolgia is indeed not dead.</li></ol><h2>Powers</h2><p>Violator/Clown displays some differences in his powers depending which form he takes.</p><p>Violator possesses</p><ul><li>superior strength,</li><li>shape shifting abilities,</li><li>unarmed combat abilities,</li><li>Breath fire/ Energy beams</li><li>Since he is a demon certain Earthly limitations do not apply to him and he can do things like breath both air and water and does not need to eat to survive.</li><li>Has the ability to jam guns.</li><li>Telepathy</li></ul><p>The Violator can also take control and possess Humans and animals effortlessly, and by the hundreds. His followers are marked with a blue \"M\" similar to his clown form.</p><h2>TV Shows</h2><h3>Todd McFarlane's Spawn</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2046294-04violator.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2046294\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2046294-04violator.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2046294\"><img alt=\"Violator/Clown\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67602/2046294-04violator.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/67602/2046294-04violator.jpg 640w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67602/2046294-04violator.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Violator/Clown</figcaption></figure><p>Violator/Clown, appeared in the Spawn animated series as one of the main villains taunting spawn at every turn. Clown was voiced by Michael Nicolosio and Violator was voiced by James Hanes. Clown tormented <a href=\"/spawn/4005-3381/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3381\">Al Simmons</a>, the newest Hellspawn, during his training on Earth. Since Hell leaves no Hellspawn unchecked, Clown was sent to be his \u201cescort.\u201d Telling him that his <a href=\"/wanda-fitzgerald/4005-3394/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3394\">wife</a> has left him and that he\u2019s no good to serve <a href=\"/malebolgia/4005-4957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4957\">Malebolgia</a>, Clown was being an all around pain in the ass to Spawn.</p><p>Clown interfered whenever he could, giving <a href=\"/billy-kincaid/4005-10521/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10521\">Kincaid</a> the heads up on <a href=\"/cyan/4005-23405/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23405\">Wanda\u2019s daughter</a>, allying himself with <a href=\"/jason-wynn/4005-3391/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3391\">Wynn</a> and countless other small things that did nothing but anger Spawn.</p><p>The \u201cClown\u201d is but a \u201cskin\u201d for this being, his real form being that of Violator. One of the <a href=\"/the-phlebiac-brothers/4060-48927/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48927\">The Phlebiac Brothers</a>, in his Violator form he is a formidable opponent for Spawn. Obviously he cannot walk around as such an obvious demon all day, hence his \u201cClown\u201d skin. Violator's true form is only shown briefly in three episodes while his clown form appears in most of the episodes of the series.</p><h2>Phlebiac Brothers</h2><p>Violator is the eldest of the five <a href=\"/the-phlebiac-brothers/4060-48927/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48927\">Phlebiac Brothers</a>. He also was the one to kill his father for reasons unknown. Although his brothers were family, Violator always hated his brothers, simply for the fact that they annoyed him and that he was older. Violator later dishonored the name Phlebiac by being banned into his human form by Malebolgia for lowering the crime rate in New York by killing numerous mafia members, because of this, Violator was going to be killed by his brothers. However Violator regained his power in desperate attempt from Spawn by making a deal with him. Violator returned to face his brothers, he succeeded with ease, by ripping off his brother Vandilizer's head and tricking a mercenary the mafia hired to attack them and learn them back into the gate way to Hell. The five Phlebia Brothers consist of Violator (the oldest and most well known), Vindicator (the most sarcastic and humorous), Vacillator (the most annoying), Vaporizer (the dumbest and largest) and Vandalizer (the most over confident).</p><h2>Games</h2><p>The Violator made his appearance in Spawn Armageddon. He was one of the first bosses, he still thinks Spawn doesn't deserve to be a ranking officer of hells army and tries to kill him. He also appeared in Todd McFarlane's Spawn for Super Nintendo. He quickly shifts into his demon form to fight.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Violator makes an appearance in the beginning of Grim Tales a web comic from Snafu-comics.com</p>",

  "deck": "Yajirobe is a character from the manga/anime Dragonball and Dragonball Z. He isn't very strong or brave but is skilled with a katana and has come through in past situations.",
  "description": "<h2>Dragon Ball</h2><h3>King Piccolo Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe was first introduced in the King Piccolo Saga as a wandering ronin with an insatible appetite. He met Goku after the latter ate his breakfast which consisted of a huge fish. Upset, Yajirobe engaged Goku in combat.</p><p>The two had an even fight and both surprised each other with their strength and endurance. After stalemating, they were approached by the third spawn of King Piccolo named Cymbol who was after the Dragonball Yajirobe owned.</p><p>After winning a game of Rock - Paper - Scissors with Goku, Yajirobe personally challenges Cymbol in a fight. Yajirobe quickly recovers from Cymbol's physical blows and successfully evades the demon's Beam Rays as he sprints towards Cymbol and slices him with ease. Cymbol is then subsequently roasted and eaten by Yajirobe as a replacement for his lost fish.</p><p>Afterwards, Yajirobe witnesses Goku murder Tamborine in revenge for Krillin, and hides as King Piccolo brutally beats down Goku. Yajirobe helps the severely injured Goku and decides to help him get to Korin Tower after being promised special food by Goku.</p><p>With the initial assisted help from Bora, Yajirobe manages to successfully climb to the top of Korin Tower with Goku on his back. Once at the top, Yajirobe gets aquinted with Korin and introduced to the rejuvinating Senzu Beans.</p><p>Later, Yajirobe watches Goku power up from the Ultra Divine Water and King Piccolo's demise at the hands of Goku. Yajirobe manages to saves Goku's life by catching him before he hit the ground, and is seen leaving with Goku to heal his wounds at the Korin Tower.</p><h3>Piccolo Jr. Saga</h3><p>Three years later, Yajirobe disguises himself and enters the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament. Unfortunately, Yajirobe is easily defeated by a disguised Kami in the last match of the preliminaries.</p><p>After the end of the Tournament, Yajirobe assists a severely injured Goku by handing him a Senzu Bean.</p><h2>Dragonball Z</h2><h3>Saiyan Saga</h3><p>After a five year timeskip, Yajirobe is instructed by Kami gather all of the Z-Fighters to receive training for the arrival of two more Saiyans after the Saiyan Raditz. Yajirobe arrives at Kami House and delivers the message to Krillin who in turn alerts the others.</p><p>Once at Kami's Lookout, Yajirobe trains with Krillin, Yamcha, Chiaotzu, and Tien for a year. Despite his lack of enthusiasm and spending most of his time eating, he does end up surpassing Kami and Mr. Popo in power.</p><p>When the Saiyans finally arrive, Yajirobe initially decides to not get involved but eventually watches from the sidelines as Goku battles Vegeta and most of the Z-Fighters except Krillin and Gohan are dead.</p><p>At a seemingly hopeless moment in the battle, Yajirobe unexpectedly pulls through as he cuts of the tail of Vegeta transformed as a Great Ape from behind. This results in Vegeta losing his transformation and most of his power.</p><p>When Vegeta eventually reclaims the upper hand, Yajirobe once agains helps out by slashing Vegeta's battle armor from behind to protect Gohan. Yajirobe initially assumes he killed Vegeta and arrogantly brags about his victory. Once Vegeta regains conciousness, he brutally beats down Yajirobe as payback.</p><p>However, Yajirobe's distraction provided Gohan enough time to look at Vegeta's present Power Ball and transform into a Great Ape to eventually defeat Vegeta.</p><h3>Namek Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe is seen with the group at Wunkong Hospital in West City healing from his injuries from the battle with the Saiyans. Yajirobe's injuries were relatively minor, so he wasn't kept in the hospital like Goku.</p><p>Yajirobe eventually delivers a new crop of Senzu Beans to Goku to instantly heal from his injuries and allow Goku to travel to Namek.</p><h3>Android Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe briefly appears in the Android Saga to deliver a fresh bag of Senzu Beans to the Z-Fighters but doesn't join the join out of not wanting to get killed.</p><p>While leaving in his hovercraft, Yajirobe is attacked by Androids 20 and 19. However, he survives and is carried to safety by the Z-Fighters.</p><p>Eventually, Yajirobe is seen at Korin Tower as Goku tests his new power in front of Korin to compare to Perfect Cell.</p><h3> Majin Buu Saga</h3><p>Yajirobe is seen continuing to stay at Korin Tower and is eventually killed by either Super Buu's Human Extinction Act, or Kid Buu's destruction of Earth from his Planet Burst attack.</p><p>Although he did not see the significance in raising his hands, Yajirobe participates in giving his energy to Goku's Super Spirit Bomb to eventually destroy Majin Buu for good.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>At the time of his introduction, Yajirobe appeared to be amongest the strongest humans alive.</p><p>Yajirobe was able to contend with Goku in an even fight and managed to kill Cymbal who was a minion of King Piccolo. Yajirobe also managed to climb up Korin's tower on his first try with Goku on his back with greater ease than Goku himself who initially struggled to climb the tower.</p><p>However, as the series goes on, Yajirobe quickly becomes outclassed and suprassed by not only Goku but even the other primary Z-Fighters and antagonists. This is the result of his laziness and cowardly nature. Despite this, Yajirobe still managed to acheive a power greater than Kami himself after bare minimal training for the Saiyans and is the strongest Earthling unable to utilize Ki.</p><p>Yajirobe is also a skilled swordsman being able to slash through tough objects or enemies thicker than the katana with ease. This played a vital role in the Saiyan Saga when Yajirobe managed to cut off Vegeta's tail while he was transformed as a Great Ape despite a monstrous power gap.</p><p> </p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Flash and Kill - A rush attack where Yajirobe slashes an opponent into the air and then waits for the enemy to fall back down. As the enemy hits the ground, Yajirobe slashes them again.</p><p>Gigantic Rock Throw - Yajirobe uses his strength to hurl a boulder at his enemy.</p><p>Ka-Blam Hammer - Yajirobe rushes full speed at the opponent and knocks them up into the air, sending them propelling. Yajirobe then flies after them and performs a combination of four punches and smashes them down.</p><p>Ka-Blam Slicer - Yajirobe creates a very large beam of energy from his sword and launches it at the opponent.</p><p>Ki Slash - Yajirobe is able to form an energy slash from his katana. This attack is the only energy based attack Yajirobe knows.</p><p>Miracle Ka-Blam Slash - A rush attack where Yajirobe uses his katana for a flurry of sword attacks finishing with one final slice. Yajirobe used part of this move to slice off <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a>'s tail.</p><h2>Alternate Timeline</h2><p>In the alternate timeline where Goku died of a heart virus and the Z-Fighters never learned of the Androids eventual attack, Yajirobe was one of the fighters who was killed in battle by the Androids. Gohan was the only survivor of the battle and went on to train Future Trunks.</p><h2>Other Media</h2>",

  "deck": "Yamcha, the notorious desert bandit, is a fictional character from the manga Dragon Ball and the anime Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z.",
  "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Yamcha entered the series early in Dragon Ball as an antagonistic desert bandit; he ambushed <a href=\"/goku/4005-19765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19765\">Son Goku</a>, <a href=\"/bulma-briefs/4005-40729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40729\">Bulma</a> and <a href=\"/oolong/4005-19776/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19776\">Oolong</a> as they were traveling the desert in order to steal their money and capsules. When challenged by Goku, they fought each other until the presence of Bulma made him retreat due to his fear of women. Yamcha returned to their camp that night and, while spying on them, learned of the Dragon Balls and their ability to grant a wish, he then decided to steal their <a href=\"/dragon-balls/4055-46445/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46445\">Dragon Balls</a> and make a wish to overcome his phobia. He and his companion <a href=\"/puar/4005-61743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61743\">Puar</a> broke into the groups van one night to do so, but were foiled when the orbs under the sheet which Yamcha thought were Dragon Balls were actually the breasts of a nude and sleeping Bulma, causing him to leave in a confused daze. He attacked again the following day, destroying the group's van with a panzerfaust, but was again challenged by Goku and retreated when Goku damaged his vanity by knocking one of his teeth out.</p><p>Realizing that he probably can't beat Goku in a fight, Yamcha instead decided to let the group collect all seven balls and then steal them. He again came to the group, this time apologizing for his behavior, and gave them a car to make up for destroying their van; the car of course had a tracking device in it.</p><p>While on the groups trail, Yamcha encounters a mysterious girl; she mistakes him for a monster and attacks him, causing him to retaliate and knock her out. Later, when eavesdropping on Goku's conversation with Gyu Mao (the <a href=\"/ox-king/4005-61744/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61744\">Ox King</a>), he realizes that the girl is <a href=\"/chi-chi/4005-40807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40807\">Chi-Chi</a>, Gyu Mao's daughter. Not wanting to face the wrath of an angry Gyu Mao, Yamcha races back to the scene and apologizes to Chi-Chi, saying he did what he did because he is crazy with love for her. He quickly hides when he sees Goku coming and, by luck, witnesses Chi-Chi pull Goku's tail, exposing his weak spot. Yamcha returns to Gyu Mao's castle and remains hidden as Goku returns with Chi-Chi and <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Muten Roshi</a>, the legendary martial arts master who trained both Gyu Mao and Goku's grandfather <a href=\"/grandpa-gohan/4005-60657/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60657\">Son Gohan</a>. He is awed by R\u00f4shi's display of the Kamehameha, an energy wave R\u00f4shi used with the intention of putting out the massive fire at Gyu Mao's residence but instead destroyed the castle and the entire mountain it was on. He also can't help but be somewhat envious after Goku is chosen by R\u00f4shi to be his disciple.</p><p>Yamcha continues to tail the group after they recover the sixth Dragon Ball from Gyu Mao into a remote village; there, he has to intervene and help Goku after Bulma is turned into a carrot by the Carrot Master. He orders Puar to turn into a bird and rescue the hostage carrot-Bulma while he takes out the Carrot Master's two henchmen; Yamcha quickly hides again after this, letting Goku deal with the gang without having to worry about Bulma's safety.</p><p>When <a href=\"/pilaf/4005-61747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61747\">Pilaf'</a>s henchmen ambush Goku, Bulma and Oolong, stealing five of their six balls along with destroying their car, Yamcha has to again intervene, this time joining the group. They track the balls to Pilaf's castle but are soon trapped. From a hole blasted in the wall by Goku they witness Pilaf summoning the dragon and Yamcha orders Puar to go with Oolong and stop it. Pilaf's wish is interrupted by them and, as punishment, the group is moved into a giant solar-oven like cell to die the next day when the sun comes up; they are not contained long though before Goku transforms into a giant ape and destroys their cell by the light of the full moon. Just as Goku's about to crush Bulma, who'se pinned by some rubble, Yamcha comes to the rescue and grabs his tail, stunning him long enough for Puar to transform into a giant pair of scissors and cut the tail off, returning Goku to his normal state. The next morning, with the balls now inert, the gang goes their separate ways. Yamcha and Bulma are satisfied though, as they now have each other and, therefore, no need to make any wishes. They go with Bulma back to the city while Goku goes off to train with Muten-R\u00f4shi.</p><p>Yamcha next meets up with Goku at the <a href=\"/21st-tenkaichi-budoukai/4045-55868/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55868\">21st Tenkaichi Budoukai</a> where he makes it to the quarter-finals, but is eliminated by <a href=\"/master-roshi/4005-53244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53244\">Jackie Chun</a>, who dodges all of Yamcha's attacks and knocks him out of the ring with a simple hand gesture; this level of power, along with the physical likeness causes Yamcha to (rightly) suspect Chun is Muten-R\u00f4shi in disguise.</p><p>After the tournament Yamcha is not seen again until near the end of the Red Ribbon Army Saga when he is informed that Goku is making a head-on assault at Red Ribbon's headquarters and is called by Bulma to assist. By the time Yamcha and the others arrive though, the battle is over, with Goku victorious.</p><p>Regardless, Yamcha decides to accompany Goku and travels with him to see the fortune-teller <a href=\"/fortuneteller-baba/4005-61822/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61822\">Uranai Baba</a> and learn the location of the last Dragon Ball. Baba doesn't give readings free though and will only do it after her five warriors are beaten. Yamcha faces her second warrior, the invisible man.</p><p>Unable to see his opponent Yamcha can\u2019t land a blow and was losing the match. He tried to locate his opponent by sound, but is foiled when Baba starts singing. Kuririn thinks quickly though and brings both Bulma and Roshi to the ring; he then exposes Bulma's breasts causing Roshi to have a nose bleed which covers the invisible man. With his opponent now visible, Yamcha uses his Rogafufuken and quickly dispatches him.</p><p>Baba then takes the warriors to a new ring, the Devil's toilet which has a thin platform over a pool of powerful acid. In this arena Yamcha battles his next opponent, Myra, who is both a fast and strong mummy. Things look bad for Yamcha until he manages a quick sneak attack, tripping the mummy off the ledge; though it is proved futile as the mummy is able to use his bandages like a rope and climb his way back up. They fight again, and again Yamcha is pummeled until, being held up by his neck over the ledge, he surrenders.</p><p>Goku takes over the fighting at this point and defeats the mummy with one hit, as well as the rest of Baba's fighters. It isn't in vain for Yamcha though, as Roshi accepts him to become one of his students.</p><p>Three years later, Yamcha competes in the <a href=\"/22nd-tenkaichi-budoukai/4045-55869/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55869\">22nd Tenkaichi Budoukai</a>.</p><p>While in the preliminaries he has confrontational words with <a href=\"/tien/4005-45675/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45675\">Tenshinhan</a>, the prize student of a rival school. When the finals are about to begin, Tenshinhan has his partner <a href=\"/chao-zu/4005-19773/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19773\">Chaozu</a> magically fix the fight schedule numbering so that he and Yamcha face off first in the quarterfinals.</p><p>In their fight, they seem to be relatively even at the start, trading an equal number of blows. Yamcha then attempts his Shin Rogafufuken, but it is beaten by Tenshihan who parries the assault and counters with a quick punch to Yamcha's gut. Yamcha decides to go all out and utilizes, to everyone's surprise, the Kamehameha; this is stopped by Tenshinhan who reflects the attack back at Yamcha and quickly counters, knocking him out. Tenshinhan does not stop at that though, and shatters the unconscious Yamcha's leg with a diving knee attack. (Note that this is Yamcha's only tournament match where he is defeated by KO rather than ring-out).</p><p>Yamcha is eliminated by KO and goes to the local hospital and can only listen to the remainder of the fights on the radio. He arrives back at the arena once the tournament is over where a now reformed Tenshinhan apologizes for the unnecessary beating.</p><p>Due to his injuries, Yamcha spends the majority of the following the King Piccolo Saga on the sidelines. He is powerless to intervene as first Kuririn, followed by Goku, and then Roshi and Chaozu are killed by the Evil Demon King. When he learns of <a href=\"/king-piccolo/4005-61755/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61755\">King Piccolo</a>'s takeover of the world capital, as well as Tenshinhan's seemingly suicidal mission to take him out, Yamcha joins in and races to the scene. He arrives with Bulma and <a href=\"/launch/4005-19770/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19770\">Lunch</a> only to find it a desolate wasteland. They soon encounter a battered Tenshinhan who fills them in that Goku's actually alive and defeated the Demon King; Yamcha then assists Tenshinhan in getting back to the Turtle House to recover.</p><p>Not long after, Goku quickly bursts in and announces that he is training with <a href=\"/kami/4005-19772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19772\">Kami</a> before taking off again after recovering his nyoi-b\u014d (a magic bo staff). This knowledge causes Yamcha to redouble his preparation for the next Tenka'ichi Budokai.</p><p>Yamcha trains along with Tenshinhan and the resurrected Kuririn and Chaozu until Kame Sen'nin informed them that, to be able to reach Goku's level of power, they are going to need to find better ways to train than those available at the Kame House. After that, they all head to <a href=\"/korin/4005-61821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61821\">Karin</a>'s Tower and train with him before each going their own separate way in preparing for the next, <a href=\"/23rd-tenkaichi-budoukai/4045-55867/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55867\">23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai</a>.</p><p>Yamcha next meets with the group at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai, he has trained for last three years for this tournament (earning his trademark scars in the process) and looks forward to the fights.</p><p>Yamcha makes it to the quarter-finals and must contend with a nerdy human named Shen and finds himself injured by what seem like accidental clumsy mistakes made by his opponent. When they both state that they'll fight seriously, Shen proves to be a fighter in a class well beyond Yamcha and quickly counters every move Yamcha makes. In desperation Yamcha uses his secret weapon, the Sokidan, a powerful ball of guided energy. While it proves to be an effective attack, it's ultimately futile as Shen (who is actually Kami) recovers from being hit with it and knocks Yamcha out of the ring.</p><p>Yamcha can only watch from there on out, in awe at the massive power displayed in the fight between Goku and Piccolo at which he is powerless to intervene. When Goku eventually does defeat Piccolo, Yamcha joins the others in celebrating his victory.</p><h2>Saiyans and the Afterlife</h2><p>After Goku sacrifices his life to defeat <a href=\"/raditz/4005-45986/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45986\">Raditz</a>, Yamcha is summoned along with <a href=\"/yajirobe/4005-45990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45990\">Yajirobe</a>, Tenshinhan, Kuririn and Chaozu train at <a href=\"/kamis-lookout/4020-52288/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-52288\">Kami's Lookout</a> for the battle against <a href=\"/vegeta/4005-40722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40722\">Vegeta</a> and <a href=\"/nappa/4005-45708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45708\">Nappa</a>. After completing Kami's training he then trains on his own until the <a href=\"/saiyans/4060-47197/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47197\">Saiyans</a> arrive.</p><p>Yamcha arrives at the battlefield just prior to the fight beginning, and volunteers to do battle with one of Nappa's spawned <a href=\"/saibamen/4060-58909/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58909\">Saibamen</a> after Tenshinhan defeats one. Yamcha's fight with the Saibaiman is fast, and he seemingly defeats the creature after evading its attack and smashing it with a Kamehameha from behind. He then lowers his guard, thinking the creature is destroyed, but it was quite alive and was able to leap and cling onto him and self-destruct, killing both Yamcha and itself.</p><p>Yamcha, along with Tenshinhan, Chaozu and <a href=\"/piccolo/4005-40727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40727\">Piccolo</a> (who were also killed in the battle with the Saiyans), goes on to train with <a href=\"/king-kai/4005-56293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56293\">North Kai\u014d</a> in the afterlife just as Goku did, growing greatly in power. Through Kaio, he is able to witness his friends battles on Planet <a href=\"/namek/4020-57097/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57097\">Namek</a>; when Goku is thought to have been killed in the destruction of Namek after defeating <a href=\"/frieza/4005-40737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40737\">Freeza</a>, Yamcha relays the information to everyone through Bulma. He is returned to life 130 days later in the first batch of wishes from <a href=\"/porunga/4005-58447/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58447\">Porunga</a> and continues to live at <a href=\"/capsule-corporation/4020-56243/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56243\">Capsule Corp</a> with Bulma and now Vegeta.</p><h2>The Androids and Cell</h2><p>When a rebuilt Freeza and his father (<a href=\"/king-cold/4005-45782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45782\">King Cold</a>) invades the Earth, Yamcha is one of the defenders who prepares to confront him, though he is overwhelmed by the tyrants' power. He is just as amazed as everyone else though when a mysterious youth suddenly appears and quickly destroys Freeza and his force. He listened to the youth, who claims that Goku will be arriving shortly and, after waiting for Goku's return, witnesses their sparring in awe. He was then filled in by Piccolo, who could hear the entire conversation between the two, that in three years powerful androids will appear and kill everyone if they are not fully prepared; Goku invited Yamcha to train with him, but Yamcha refused, saying that he liked training at his own pace. Nevertheless, he spent the next three years in training for the Androids' arrival. During this time, he and Bulma breakup once and for all. Interestingly, though the exact circumstances of their separation in the present time line are never stated, in the Japanese version of the anime <a href=\"/trunks/4005-40747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40747\">Trunks</a> explains to Goku that in his world, Yamcha was a playboy and because of that Bulma got fed up with him and left him for good so there's a good chance that this is the reason Bulma left him in the present.</p><p>After the three years, Yamcha meets Goku, <a href=\"/gohan/4005-40743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40743\">Gohan</a>, Piccolo and Tenshinhan at the location of the androids arrival. Realizing that they can't sense the androids, the group splits up and searches the city for them. Yamcha is the first to find them, and unaware that the two are the androids is quickly grabbed around the mouth by <a href=\"/android-20/4005-40811/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40811\">Android 20</a> (Dr. Gero), draining his energy and preventing him from calling for backup or battling them. Yamcha is then incapacitated after Dr. Gero punches a hole clean through his mid-section; the sudden drop in his ki alerts the rest of the group though, and they arrive shortly after.</p><p>Kuririn quickly takes Yamcha away from the battle and gives him a senzu, causing him to recover to full strength. Though he doesn't want to fight the androids again, he then tags along to watch the fight and, after Goku succumbs to his heart disease, takes him home to get him his medicine. Yamcha soon after transports Goku to <a href=\"/kame-house/4020-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55766\">Kame House</a> to hide him from androids <a href=\"/android-16/4005-45707/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45707\">16</a>, <a href=\"/android-17/4005-40804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40804\">17</a> and <a href=\"/android-18/4005-40728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40728\">18</a>.</p><p>From watching the news he hears of the new threat, <a href=\"/cell/4005-40806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40806\">Cell</a>, a monster that goes around absorbing people. He aids Piccolo on the search for Cell by piloting a plane so it won't detect their ki, but it continuously evades them. When the androids later arrive on Roshi's island looking for Goku, Yamcha stays behind while Piccolo goes off with them to fight on a deserted island.</p><p>When Cell broadcasts his intentions to hold his Cell Games, a tournament of sorts with himself as the only opponent, Yamcha decides to enter. Yamcha does not get the opportunity to fight until Cell creates his <a href=\"/cell-jr/4005-52302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52302\">Cell Juniors</a>, who attack the <a href=\"/z-fighters/4060-41028/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41028\">Z Fighters</a> and quickly take most of them, including Yamcha, out. He quickly recovers after eating a senzu once Gohan destroys the Cell Jr's and spends the rest of the match as an observer.</p><p>Once Gohan finally destroys Cell, he carries Gohan back to Kami's Lookout and then makes the wish to resurrect everyone killed by Cell. When the group has difficulty thinking of a second wish, he jokingly contemplates asking the dragon for an expensive diamond necklace for the girl he's going out with. He and the rest of the group see Trunks off as he leaves for his own time and then they go their separate ways.</p><h2>Majin Buu</h2><p>Seven years later, Yamcha attends the 25th Tenkaichi Budoukai as a spectator since he gave up fighting. Soon the tournament is interrupted though as the other Z Fighters leave, and then return with Vegeta now possessed by an evil wizard.</p><p>After Majin Vegeta attacked the crowd, Yamcha went with Bulma and a few others to ask <a href=\"/shenron/4005-56391/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56391\">Shenron</a> to resurrect all non-evil-doers who were killed that day. He then heads to Kami's Lookout to take refuge from the assault of the new terror, <a href=\"/buu/4005-41116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41116\">Buu</a>, and witnesses Goten and Trunks first attempts at fusion. When Buu eventually finds them and attacks, Yamcha is quickly turned into chocolate and eaten with the others.</p><p>Later Yamcha and Krillin are attacked in heaven by Buu,tought they best efforts they are no match for Buu, however before Buu could kill then (according to Goku if Buu killed either of then,they would disappear forever),Goku and Vegeta power up to call Buu's attention</p><p>He is eventualy resurrected among the others , Yamcha's last real action in the series is giving Goku his energy to help form the Genki Dama that defeats Kid Buu.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Yamcha was one of Goku's first antagonists and later one his first allies that could compete with him in terms of martial ability. Yamcha lived his early life as a desert bandit and used both guns and a large schimitar to steal capsules and money from travelers. He originally did not have any energy attacks, relying on fast and swift martial arts moves to overwhelm opponents. Later under Master Roshi, Yamcha begins to be able to utilze his energy for flight, energy blasts, and even learns the Kamehameha wave as well. Yamcha is later eclipsed in DBZ due to the Saiyans increase in power though he remains one of the most powerful humans on Earth along with <a href=\"/uub/4005-58243/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58243\">Uub</a>, Tien, and Krillian. Yamcha would go on to give up fighting as he didn't see the point since he could not keep up with Goku or Vegeta.</p><p><strong>Super Strength:</strong> By the end of DBZ, Yamcha can lift approx. 50 tons. He is immensely strong, but not among the strongest of the Z Warriors (we see him struggle to even move in 100x gravity, when he attempts to train in the same space capsule in which Vegeta was training during the beginning of the Android Saga)</p><p><strong>Super Speed :</strong> Yamcha can fly at about Mach 2.</p><p><strong>Energy manipulation:</strong> Yamcha is an expert at ki manipulation and has come up with various ki techniques. His highest power blast is easily at continent wrecking level.</p><h4>Techniques</h4><p>Fusion Dance - A video game only power, Yamcha can perform the Fusion Dance with Tien to form Tiencha.</p><p>Kamehameha Wave - Yamcha uses the signature move of the Turtle School and forms a large blue energy wave between his palms and fires the blast after saying the name of the technique.</p><p>Spirit Ball - Yamcha forms a large yellow energy ball from his palm and the can control it via hand movements. The ball seems to do more concussive damage as if it was made of matter instead of energy.</p><p>Super Spirit Ball - Is Yamcha's most powerful attack where he forms an even larger energy ball and throws it as his opponent which hits them multiple times before exploding on them.</p><p>Spirit Punch - Yamcha energies his fist with energy and delivers a close range hit with added damage.</p><p>Wolf Fang Fist - Yamcha's signature move which are a series of quick punches, swipes, and kicks. A wolfs howl is heard during the initiation of the move.</p><h2>Alternate Timeline</h2><p>In the alternate timeline where Goku died from a heart virus and the Z-Fighters never learned of the eventual attak of the Androids, Yamcha was killed by Android 17 by an energy wave through the chest. Yamcha was the thris Z-Fighter killed after Vegeta, but before Tien. Gohan was the only survivor of the battle and would eventually go on to train Future Trunks.</p><h2>Video Games</h2><ul><li>Data Carddass Dragon Ball Z</li><li>Dragon Ball</li><li>Dragon Ball 3: Gokuuden</li><li>Dragon Ball: Advanced Adventure</li><li>Dragon Ball: Daimaou Fukkatsu</li><li>Dragonball: Evolution</li><li>Dragon Ball Heroes</li><li>Dragon Ball Kai: Ultimate But\u014dden</li><li>Dragon Ball Online</li><li>Dragon Ball: Origins.</li><li>Dragon Ball: Origins 2</li><li>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast</li><li>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2</li><li>Dragon Ball: Revenge of King Piccolo</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Bakuretsu Impact</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi.</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Collectible Card Game</li><li>Dragon Ball: Zenkai Battle Royal</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Goku Hish\u014dden</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu</li><li>Dragon Ball Z II: Gekigami Freezer</li><li>Dragon Ball Z III: Ressen Jinzou Ningen</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World</li><li>Dragon Ball Z: Kyoushuu!
